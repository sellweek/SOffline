  <row Id="12" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2" CreationDate="2016-01-12T19:13:00.710" Score="11" Body="&lt;p&gt;There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) &lt;a href=&quot;http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399&quot;&gt;do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its &quot;natural&quot; origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since &quot;natural&quot; materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against &quot;natural&quot; materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a &quot;safer&quot; printers or using &quot;safer&quot; materials diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" LastActivityDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" CommentCount="2" />

The temperature setpoint of 210 was high enough to cause this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second possible cause, insufficient retraction, can also be blamed for this issue. Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2016-01-12T20:21:03.017" CommentCount="0" />

More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures.

Sharp corners will often be rounded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety and Handling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS.

ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature.

The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Completely &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/should-i-enclose-my-3d-printer&quot;&gt;enclose/seal your machine's build area&lt;/a&gt; to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C.

When printing with wet filament, you'll sometimes hear it popping and see steam coming out of the extruder (it's usually only this extreme with nylon).  With most other filaments, when they're wet, the extruded filament will have small bubbles in it and the surface finish of the parts will be rougher, with breaks in the layer lines.  It can also lead to more oozing and stringing.  Air print a few centimeters of filament and look at it closely to see if there's any bubbles, if not, it's probably dry enough.  Whether the filament absorbs enough water to be noticeable in a few hours, in a day, or in a week depends a lot on the filament (and I assume the humidity too).  I'm mostly noticed problems with nylon, ABS, and NinjaFlex, less with PLA and PETG (though I avoid leaving any filament out for more than a day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not seeing any difference between, then I wouldn't worry about it.

An acetone &quot;explosion&quot; is even more unlikely, since you need a ratio of 2.5%-12.8% acetone vapor to air for that: too much acetone (as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel) and nothing happens, too little (as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room) and nothing happens either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated, ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of (liquid) acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5%.

However, limited skin contact isn't a big deal: acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is heavier than air, so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If somehow a fire does start, it will likely be limited to your container.

Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic, though it isn't something you should be careless around either. The risk of starting a fire is small.

There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural &quot;grain&quot; of the print (ie each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part.

I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine &quot;bridge&quot; the circular profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (ie hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy(ies) in high-stress areas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-01-13T05:01:54.163" CommentCount="0" />

Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish.

This is my situation - where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous --&gt; Treat It As Dangerous&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key information at this point in time is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;the UFP (Ultra-Fine Particle) study&lt;/a&gt; that is linked in &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/12/188&quot;&gt;Tom's answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving out the scary / detailed parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, results herein suggest that caution should be used when&#xA;  operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered&#xA;  indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One important limitation to this study is that we have no information&#xA;  about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type&#xA;  of 3D printer [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] there may also be&#xA;  differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical&#xA;  composition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that although many processes release UFPs (the authors of the paper compare to cooking), all UFPs are not created equal. Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Filtering&lt;/strong&gt; - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?area=en&amp;amp;tid=wh_positive&quot;&gt;positive vs negative pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Which Printer?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard.

They each have different requirements and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notably, IP law varies from country to country.  WIPO has made significant inroads into regularizing IP law across many countries, but this answer will still focus on a US-centric reading of US IP law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Copyright law&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's already established that printed works, such as photographs, texts, and similar works will result in prosecution against the person and the company that the person outsourced the copying of the copyrighted work to.  Attempt to copy a book or copyrighted photo at a paper copy shop and they will typically refuse to reduce their liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you show that you have rights to the work, through educational use laws, for instance, they may still refuse because they may be putting themselves in danger of a lawsuit by a particularly aggressive copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This applies to 3D printing shops in a similar manner.  If you don't know the source of the 3D model, and that the person has a right to the model, you may find yourself liable for copyright infringement.

Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next I'd look at the print head.  If it has blockages, or poor temperature control this could result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'd check the mechanisms - disconnect the motors and see if all the carriages slide smoothly without any binding, particularly the Z axis.

Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take special care with endstops.

The plastic should stick nicely during printing, yet release reasonably easily when you remove the print from the heated bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lay down a later of Kapton tape. The principle is the same as masking tape, but Kapton tape has a smooth surface and is more durable than masking tape. The down side is Kapton tape is far more expensive, and applying it correctly is a LOT more work, since you have to use water and you have to keep bubbles from getting underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put some ABS scraps into a bottle of Acetone, and allow the acetone to break down the ABS til you have a slurry. Spread this slurry as evenly as possible across the build plate, and allow the acetone to evaporate away. This leaves a thin film of ABS on the plate, and will release much better than if you print directly onto the build plate. I recommend using clear ABS if you can, since some of it will stick to your print and clear will be the least visible. You'll need to re-apply it regularly, since it will come off with your print where it touches the build plate. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: Use proper ventilation and avoid contact with acetone.

Also it's flammable, so keep a fire extinguisher nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I prefer the ABS/acetone slurry method, but it requires good ventilation and a handy fire extinguisher.

One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances, and vary the maximum travel speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using the calculator above, increase the &lt;em&gt;acceleration&lt;/em&gt; for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust your &lt;em&gt;jerk&lt;/em&gt; setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances. Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.no/search?q=stepper%20motor%20strength%20curve%20NEMA%2017&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=985&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi74aLL46fKAhVIdCwKHdJbDa4QsAQIGg&amp;amp;dpr=1#imgrc=NbUjFTxiWehyKM%3A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds&lt;/a&gt;, so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

As someone else stated, adjusting the distance (even slightly) can make a world of difference in how easy the supports are removed. Also bear in mind that supports can be more difficult to remove with larger layer heights, so try printing in a lower layer height.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often times, you shouldn't need to use support structures for a feature like this. I might suggest printing without supports at a reduced speed and lowered nozzle temperature. This will help ensure that the material hardens quicker, which becomes helpful higher along the arc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related to the suggestion above, you can focus your slicing setting on better bridging. This should give better control on feeds/speeds while &quot;bridging&quot; a gap between overhanging features. Some slicing engines allow you to specify a different layer height for these areas on the print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I would try printing with reduced print speed, nozzle temperature(s), and layer height with supports.

By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer (this isn't professional or legal advice)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for acetone. After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly. It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. &lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Your Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetone Chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you accidentally ignite some acetone, you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire. Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful.

With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response. If we assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50. 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone:&lt;/em&gt; dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="251" LastEditorUserId="251" LastEditDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" CommentCount="3" />

Generally, the differences are minimal, however:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter (&amp;lt;0.4mm), allowing for more precise prints in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio, allowing for faster melting in the nozzle, and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The converse of the above points is also usually true. &quot;3mm&quot; filament (which is usually actually 2.85mm) will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm, however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament—a ±0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only ±3.5% for 2.85mm and more like ±6.7% for 1.75mm, so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer, resulting in lower-than-expected print quality. That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive, higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your printer's hardware setup matters, too: Bowden-based printers, like the Ultimaker 2, generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect, causing extra pressure in the nozzle. This will often cause blobbing, stringing, and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter, but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T18:46:49.003" CommentCount="0" />

Other (albeit traditional) manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts.

However, as 3D printing is additive manufacturing, it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern.

The first time, MakerBot graciously replaced it. However, they replaced with the same model board with no apparent fix for the commonly faulty voltage regulator. I can't afford the now $500 replacement board, so my option is to replace the faulty component and hope no further damage was taken on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As MakerBot Industries did not need me to send in my old board, I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://coolate.com/blog/blog/2015/02/23/its-alive-makerbot-replicator-repaired/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;followed these steps&lt;/a&gt; to try and replace the voltage regulator on the old board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've offset the voltage regulator towards the power jack, jumped the remaining pin on the voltage regulator to the remaining lead on the board (where the old voltage regulator was), but I'm confused what/where the green wire does/goes (mine is blue on my machine). The image looks like he just soldered it onto the heat sink pad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to test it by plugging in the power and the RGB LED strip. The stepper motor driver LEDs turned on, but the LED strip and none of the other on-board LEDs turned on. I'm not very seasoned when it comes to electronics, so can anyone explain what the actual pinout should be or suggest other ways to resolve this issue?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Update: Old Board Replacement&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far I've replaced the regulator on my old board with some success. Before the replacement, the board wouldn't turn on (on-board LEDs wouldn't turn on). Now, all of the proper status LEDs turn on, but the board seems to be stuck in a boot sequence. The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters (as it normally does when initializing), but just hangs up there. I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware. However, the PC couldn't find the machine and I began to smell a bit of burning. I'm not sure if this is a result of permanent damage from the original regulator failing, or improper installation of the new regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to dig around a bit more before attempting this fix on my main board.

That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors.

You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the &quot;hot&quot; tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should run TC wire all the way from the &quot;hot&quot; tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, &lt;strong&gt;you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate &quot;thermistor table&quot; (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you need to make sure:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You don't have electrical noise issues&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cold-junction compensation is working as intended&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-20T16:40:01.790" CommentCount="1" />

There's a lot of software-specific advice out there, like printing a single-wall calibration box and measuring the wall thickness. That's a good technique for Slic3r, but not for Simplify3D. It can be very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the general outline of what you should do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough calibration check&lt;/strong&gt; for printer steps/mm. Do the values in your firmware settings make sense for your linear motion hardware? For example, you can calculate what the theoretical values SHOULD be based on belt pitch and pulley tooth count. Print something moderately big (~100-200mm) and check if it's +/-1-2%. If it's off by more than that, your steps/mm is probably wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for mechanical backlash&lt;/strong&gt; using a backlash-checking print like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490&lt;/a&gt; Tighten belts and perform other printer-specific tuning required to eliminate backlash. Backlash will throw off other calibration steps, so make sure there's no slop!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Follow the recommended &lt;strong&gt;extrusion volume calibration&lt;/strong&gt; steps for your slicer. This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer. And then you will usually either &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a single-walled box and measure the thickness&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a series of 100% infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer, you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right. Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes. Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN. Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision calibration check&lt;/strong&gt; by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING &quot;desired size&quot; as X and &quot;actual size&quot; as Y. Then find a linear fit equation, y=mx+b. (Do this separately for your printer's X, Y, and Z axes.) &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;m&quot; is your scale error.&lt;/em&gt; You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this. For example, ABS usually requires 100.3-101% scaling to account for shrinkage. If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA, you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate. &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;b&quot; is your fixed width error.&lt;/em&gt; Assuming you don't have backlash, this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides, or by extrusion volume calibration error. You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume. Many slicers also have &quot;horizontal/XY size compensation&quot; settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error. Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you follow these steps, you should get +/-0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints.*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Deltas not included.

But we don't need to get into that right now. There are really two big things to worry about: layer height and extrusion width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Layer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine. Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart. There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application. Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any typical household FFF printer with a &quot;normal&quot; nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work. It just needs to be tuned well.&lt;/strong&gt; The smallest &quot;must have&quot; feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 2] is BAD  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2 &amp;lt; Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 3] is BAD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &gt; 3] is GOOD&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output.

You can't just open a window to air out the molten-ABS smell from the ISS! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FFF printers put out fumes and nanoparticles. In a space station, the same air gets recycled over and over, and the air purification systems have a specific set of contaminants that they are optimized for, as well as a design capacity for air turnover and chemical removal rates that won't be adjusted just because somebody's printing a space-ratchet today. Protecting cabin air quality is a huge design factor for any experiment that goes into space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Made in Space printing experiments on the ISS to date were performed in one of the vacuum experiment chambers, so any unfiltered fumes (or fire flare-ups) could be vented directly to space if required. In the long run, this isn't going to work -- other experiments may need the vacuum chamber, or &quot;production&quot; printers may be too large to fit. So the printer needs to have its own internal air purification system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another MAJOR design constraint is launch survival. Rocket payloads must be designed for extreme g-forces without 1) damage, or 2) significant internal shifting of mass which would affect the payload center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total payload weight is also quite important here: lifting mass to low Earth orbit is EXPENSIVE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the microgravity environment itself isn't that big of a deal. Molten plastic is highly viscous and pretty much stays where you put it long enough to solidify, as long as it's sticking to something. But two impacts do come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, an unsecured filament spool will try to unwind itself. Gravity won't provide the contact friction we usually rely on to keep spools from bird's-nesting. (Think about it: a tightly-wound spool is literally a giant coil-spring.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, heat flows are different in microgravity -- you can't rely on passive convection to cool the print or the motors. Accommodations must be made for sufficient forced airflow and heat-sinking on anything that requires cooling. And that includes the enclosure itself, since, as mentioned above, the print chamber must be sealed up tight for air quality control. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, reliability is critical. Amazon doesn't deliver to the ISS (yet). Even a single stripped screw may take the printer out of commission for months until a replacement part can be fit into an upcoming supply launch. Having the printer catch on fire because something shorted would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, really, it's all about making a printer robust enough to make it up there, operate safely, and never break.

Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even for &quot;fast&quot; fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a &amp;lt;50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-21T04:38:42.443" CommentCount="12" />

But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work. Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer.

That is, by far, the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources. Where the speed comes in is that without a peel, a continuous &quot;movie&quot; can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers. CLIP is not necessarily faster than top-down. For example, the Gizmo 3D line of top-down printers are very similar in print speed to CLIP. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&quot;&gt;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most &quot;consumer&quot; SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds. This includes similar &quot;continuous&quot; build techniques used as in CLIP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-21T22:16:38.140" CommentCount="0" />

That's usually best, when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening. If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance, fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling. This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid.

You'd just plug and play. &lt;strong&gt;That PC power supply will potentially draw more current&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;strong&gt;the power supply of your 3D printer&lt;/strong&gt;. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a good and valid concern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above).

You can accomplish that just about any way you like, so long as you pair up the wires correctly from one motor to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming both &quot;Z&quot; motors are the same type and have the same color-coding for their wires. If not, you'll need to figure out the correspondences first (you may want to post another question if you need a hand with that, since it's pretty specific and generally useful).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many control boards have &quot;headers&quot; sticking up, with 4 bare pins for each motor.

In that case, just put a connector on each motor (if they're not there already), and plug them in next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there's just one set of header pins (or one Z-motor socket of some other kind) on your controller, make a &quot;Y-cord&quot; by soldering the wires from one connector (that plugs to the controller) to &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; 4 pin connectors, one to mate with each motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you can skip the 2 extra connectors entirely, and just solder the motor wires to the wires from the connector: 2 reds to red, 2 blacks to black, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your controller just has empty holes, either solder in header pins and do as above (preferred, imho), or wire directly into the holes, splicing the 2 sets of motor wires if there's only one set of holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Motor and connector wires are wildly inconsistent, so make sure you get them sorted out right if they aren't already. The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With RAMPS (see handy diagram at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg&lt;/a&gt;), the 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2B 2A 1A 1B&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It means coil 1 and coil 2, each of which has ends A and B. I find this unclear because it could just as well have been numbers for the coils, and letters for the ends (if you wire it that way it won't work). So be sure you have continuity (maybe 15 ohms or so) between the wires you connect to 2B and 2A, and between the wires you connect to 1A and 1B.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;really good thing&lt;/em&gt; about this pin order is that if a motor is running backwards all you have to do is power off and then turn the plug around. That's one reason I think it's important to keep connectors in there, rather than soldering directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastEditorUserId="40" LastEditDate="2016-02-01T16:11:12.260" LastActivityDate="2016-02-01T16:11:12.260" CommentCount="1" />

ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of &quot;stick together&quot; as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to use it as filament.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interesting sidenote: PLA/PHA has very favorable mechanical properties because the PHA forms a very similar flexible microstructure inside the hard PLA matrix.

If you have sandpaper made out of metal (ie stainless pla), it will scratch your skin fairly easily. If you have sandpaper made out of tree bark (ie laywood pla), it probably won't scratch your skin as bad, but it'll still scratch. And just for poops and giggles, lets say you have sandpaper made out of pla; it'll take a while, but you could eventually make your skin raw if you rub the plastic against your arm long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is typically recommended to use one nozzle for each material type as to avoid cross-contamination of materials in your printing.

Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; heat-resistant, so it won't break from thermal expansion.

It's super cheap (mine was $3 or something from lowes) and they'll often cut it to exact size. You might be able to drill this, but you have to be extremely careful. Sometimes, the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed. If you don't want to drill, a few binder clips will work just as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a note for if you are using binder clips: you might need to (depending on how your hbp is set up) get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room. If you're going with the picture frame glass, you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient (that's how glass cracks/shatters). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="156" LastActivityDate="2016-02-03T01:55:24.110" CommentCount="0" />

Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print. Whether extruding filament, laser sintering, or curing resins, the materials involved have to be fairly similar in processing environment to print adjacent to each other without issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many printers that are intended to print multiple materials by changing the print head.  You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.  Plastics imbued with wood fibers, printing next to conductive plastics with graphite, printing next to flexible plastics, etc, etc are now possible, and depending on your requirements they may meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2016-02-03T14:16:22.343" CommentCount="2" />

Same true for infill).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Smaller nozzle disadvantage (varies, debatable): higher risk of clogging. There are of course other factors which can result in clogging, but this can also affect it as even finer particles in less quality filament can get stuck now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Smallel nozzle disadvantage: since less plastic can come out at a given duration of time, it means less speedy printing of larger layer heights, if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should get back to (1) and explain why it is so.&#xA;When companies market their 3d printer they usually talk about the layer height (the Z resolution) completely ignoring the X and Y. This makes sense for marketing. Luckily it is not hard to explain what is usually left out and what is important for one of the answers to your question on what are advantages of smaller nozzles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Z resolution depends on two main things:&#xA;1) The stepper motor driver accuracy of your 3d printer's motherboard. Pretty much all are the same now. Claiming your 3d printer can print at 20 micron layer height doesn't say anything, pretty much any 3d printed today can.&#xA;2) Nozzle/extruder quality, nozzle diameter. The latter surprisingly does not determine much. Because of how FFF/FMD 3d printing works, the perimeters of your 3d print can be way thinner than your nozzle diameter. This might sound odd but there's a simple explanation: the molten plastic coming out of the hotend is squished and stretched when the head moves. Because it is stretched, it can be made thinner as you increase how much it is squished. There's not much experimentation done on this and available online, only from personal experience I can say I can print perimeters 50% thinner than my 3mm nozzle. So I suppose if you wanted thinner perimeters than that, you would need to swap to a thinner nozzle.&#xA;Why would you want thinner perimeters? To get sharper corners or in other words better X and Y resolution for your 3d prints which is ignored by most unlike the overstated &quot;layer height&quot; (Z resolution).&#xA;Here's an illustration to help you visualize how fatter perimeters and less sharp corners/edges on your 3d model result in &quot;lower X/Y resolution&quot; (the illustration is a 2d cutout, viewed from the top):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" CommentCount="2" />

That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a &quot;stack of logs&quot; structure kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you want instead is something very &quot;mashed together&quot; and strong like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand.&lt;/strong&gt; This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to &quot;heal up&quot; even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to &quot;cut corners&quot; and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer. You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results, but it's &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size. There's no hard cutoff where it will / won't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T06:19:08.443" CommentCount="5" />

That explains why you use the Arduino IDE to update or modify their firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now why you would want to use an Arduino + an Arduino shield board like RAMPS? Well if you're not good at electronics, are happy with the cost of your own board, don't care much about upgrades/modding beyond what is possible with your board, maybe you shouldn't, it might be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages with using Arduino with a shield for your 3d printer, &quot;two boards are not just the predecessors of the one board solution&quot;, no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) It is moddable/exandable/upgradable/has replacable parts.&#xA;If your printer came with its own motherboard that doesn't have additional or enough pins to add more fans, enclosure lights, a second extruder, an LCD and you want to, it sucks. RAMPS can do that, it has plenty of extra pins.&#xA;It is upgradable. You want to replace the stepper drivers with a new one? Or you accidentally damaged the one you have? Fear not, you can just replace that instead of the whole motherboard.&#xA;Think if it like other motherboards being PCs on which you can't change the CPU, RAM and GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) It is here for a long time, you will be able to acquire one for a long time.&#xA;There isn't just one company making RAMPS or similar sheilds. Sometimes 3d printing companies go out of business or stop producing your particular motherboard. RAMPS is likely here to stay. Because Arduino is very likely here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) As said above, not just one company owns or makes RAMPS or other Arduino shields. Besides the possibility of your motherboard not being produced anymore, there's also the advantage of not being at the mercy of one companies pricing and shipping policies. This is true for some other boards as well though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) It is possibly cheaper than what have you. I don't want to post a link, but one company right now is selling their derivative of Printrboard for like $180. Check the cost of Arduino Mega, stepper drivers and a RAMPS board yourself, quite a difference. That said, there are some boards which are close in price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) It's an Arduino. Why is this a good thing by itself? Because many people who have a 3d printer are tinkerers/makers and they already use Arduino for other projects. It is open source with a rich library to control many things. The modding and upgrades for your 3d printer which can be done with Arduino is another level higher. Or it can be a good learning experience for your future Arduino projects. If on the other hand you already use Arduino and are experienced with it, you might use it just because you know how to control it/fix it better than some specialized board you haven't seen before.

Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back.

If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it.

I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt; or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feedrates&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available. Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;All else fails&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only other suggestion is stated above, try printing duplicates on the same plate.

If you have a dual-extruding FDM printer, you could utilize a second support structure material. For example, you could print the bearings/housing in PLA and print the raft/supports using water soluble PVA. This provides a solid structure while printing without worry of having excess material in the housing (defeating the purpose of a bearing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, using the powder printer is most likely your best solution for creating the bearings (and less frustrating). Naturally, you will not need to worry about support structures as there is support inherently created as the powder is lain out for each layer. You just need to be sure that the tolerance of your model adhere to the capabilities of this machine and its post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which technology you use, be sure that your design incorporates a means of allowing support material to be taken out after the print is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T17:32:57.040" CommentCount="0" />

Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is &lt;em&gt;really, really hard&lt;/em&gt;. The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor. They are completely, utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple (eg Cartesian) printers, and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns, stuttering, pausing, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But my 8bit printer works fine,&quot; you say. No, it doesn't. Your print performance is limited by it, whether you realize it or not. Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you. For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves&#xA;across multiple gcode segments &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; print quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for &gt;60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely &quot;crowd out&quot; other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called &quot;step doubling&quot; that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a &quot;modern&quot; 3D printer controller. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T23:18:08.370" CommentCount="6" />

Most RepRap style 3d printers use thermistors. So you would need to replace the extruder temp sensors, or choose a new controller with thermocouple support. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Makerbots use 24v heaters and fans and PSUs. Most RepRap style 3d printers run on 12v (although this is slowly changing because 24v is better for performance and safety.) You can either pick a new controller that is known to be compatible with 24v, or replace all 24v-rated components with equivalent 12v-rated components. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing heatbed thermistor circuit is probably not the same kind of circuit that your new controller will expect. Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be compatible with &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. &lt;strong&gt;But there is a significantly easier approach&lt;/strong&gt; than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the &quot;pre-evil&quot; days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors.

I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #1:&lt;/strong&gt; The main surviving user forum (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&quot;&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&lt;/a&gt;) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by &lt;strong&gt;knowingly&lt;/strong&gt; releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&lt;/a&gt; (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could keep going, but you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. &lt;strong&gt;But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed&lt;/strong&gt; (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), &lt;strong&gt;there are still meaningful problems with the product line.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy &quot;Makercare&quot; or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base.

This plunger used copper washers to help adjust the tension required. Many people ended up upgrading their assemblies to the spring loaded mechanism as the plunger would either put too much or too little tension against the drive gear. Too little and the filament will not be driven into the hotend. Too much and the filament will grind against the drive gear and the drive gear may begin to &quot;eat&quot; away at the filament (especially when the filament becomes hotter). Obviously, if the drive gear is no longer able to catch on the filament, the nozzle will get clogged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even with a spring mechanism, your tension can become too high. Most of these mechanisms allow you to adjust the tension by tightening/loosening the screw holding down the spring. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me is just past when the filament can be successfully driven into the hotend. You can test this if you have control over your extrusion motor by removing the extrusion motor from its mount, leaving the spring mechanism installed on the face of the motor. Then, turn your motor on and try feeding the filament through the mechanism. Starting with no tension on the spring, begin slowly increasing tension by tightening the screw on your mechanism until the drive gear is successfully able to guide the filament through. I might even complete another half turn on the screw to account for varying diameters and plasticity states of the filament as it becomes hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps and please keep us updated on anything else you find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-21T00:46:09.740" CommentCount="1" />

Additional firmware parameters clutter up my (beginner's) brain even more (and I haven't had a too deep dive into that yet).&#xA;In general I understand that the frequency we use to send the steps to the stepper is the main determining factor, also 'reduced' by microstepping, if applied. We cannot keep the current up as much as needed due to timing/inductive/electronic properties of the motors, so we lose torque or finally steps. A higher voltage helps to bring the current up faster, so the steepness of the current increase can also limit the maximum applicable frequency. The frequency itself is given from the controller board to the motor driver, hence is set in firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, apart from what makes sense to utilize in a 3D printer setup, what are the determining factors of the stepper speeds that can be realized and how to they transform into real life values for our printers?

There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.&lt;/em&gt; Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firmware motion planners&lt;/strong&gt; can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual motor behavior, the &lt;strong&gt;inductance and back-EMF&lt;/strong&gt; introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note in the picture that there is a flat &quot;constant current&quot; region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two separate effects to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. &lt;em&gt;In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:&lt;/em&gt; it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important effect for steppers is &lt;strong&gt;mid-band resonance&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; increases the top effective speed for the motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, you can easily simulate this effect (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt;). This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-06-10T23:02:49.323" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T23:02:49.323" CommentCount="0" />

I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Size of the &quot;vaporization chamber&quot; in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1&quot;^3 to about 4&quot;^3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any &quot;proven process&quot; you come up with. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what things to look out for in starting out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's information about safety, before OP added disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;s&gt;As with any chemical, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; refer to the MSDS &lt;sup&gt;(Material Safety Data Sheet)&lt;/sup&gt;!

(How THAT is done is a different question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small &quot;linear&quot; carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*(&lt;em&gt;Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called &quot;faceted arc&quot; with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Techniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step &lt;em&gt;after every step&lt;/em&gt;. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count &lt;em&gt;so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet&lt;/em&gt;. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms.

But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong. So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain (per unit of cross-sectional area); the exact factor depends of lots of things (orientation, leverage, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you scale up by 10x, they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress, and probably snap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many, many parts will have similar issues: Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the (relative) strength -- and stiffness for the motors to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you'll want them to move far, far faster.

On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis. I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed, but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would require an amazing motor -- and really big electronics to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the printing material -- 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive, but a little hard to find, and a spool would be hard to lift.

If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bed tilt compensation &quot;auto-leveling&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full graphics LCDs&lt;/strong&gt; -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB&lt;/strong&gt; -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is &quot;modern&quot; by any stretch. &lt;em&gt;(For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.)&lt;/em&gt; The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today.&lt;/strong&gt; But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD.&lt;/strong&gt; It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RADDS is a good Due shield.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3. Anecdotally, the &quot;E&quot; version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any more made by Arduino. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular.

Specifically, the filament path between the drive gear or hob and hot end must be extremely well-constrained. 1.75mm TPE filaments (thermoplastic elastomers) will buckle in an instant if given the chance. That means they will try to squeeze out of any little opening in the filament drive path rather than being forced through the nozzle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a gap &gt;1mm &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; between your extruder drive gear and hot end? &lt;em&gt;Including the groove in the drive gear itself.&lt;/em&gt; If so, either change extruders or print something to fill the gap. Many popular extruders already have Ninjaflex conversion parts uploaded on Thingiverse or Youmagine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you using a 1.75mm bowden drive? You probably shouldn't bother with the softer TPEs like Ninaflex. Harder TPEs like Semiflex may be ok, but it's still difficult. 3mm bowden drives may perform ok. Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next problem is simply &lt;strong&gt;loading&lt;/strong&gt; the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final issue is &lt;strong&gt;print settings&lt;/strong&gt;. You ever hear the saying, &quot;you can't push a rope&quot;? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of &quot;pushing a rope&quot; that the extruder drive must do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Retract as little as possible. Turn off &quot;optional&quot; retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-29T04:09:53.643" CommentCount="1" />

Preheat, load, unload, level bed, etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts. There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters. RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional, but not really necessary 99.9% of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms. They're designed for stand-alone operation, which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers. It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software. This is &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; more reliable and higher-performance than, say, Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer. More optimization, fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user. But in exchange, you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support. It's a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element. This tends to produce a host-driven interface design, rather than an LCD-driven interface design.

There are only a few things that will throw off the thermocouple's reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Poor thermal coupling between the tip and the hot block, such as if the tip has partially pulled free of the brass thermowell crimp (this will make the hot block hotter than the reported temp)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Loss of electrical insulation between the tip and the hot block, plus some ground loop noise or stray voltage on the hot block (this will typically add noise to the reported temp)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to visually check for the first, and test for the second with a multimeter. The resistance between the board end of the thermocouple leads and the brass thermowell at the tip should be infinite / out of range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To actually check the thermocouple calibration, you have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy:&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the behavior of the printed plastic. PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual. It will string and ooze more as you print.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate:&lt;/strong&gt; Secure another reference thermocouple (such as might come with a digital multimeter) tightly to the hot block with some Kapton tape, somewhere the aluminum block is exposed. The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC.

You will probably need to dismantle much of the extruder to detach the thermocouple for this test.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, again, the problem probably isn't the TC. It's more likely either a bed tramming issue (eg too much gap between nozzle and surface) or the BuildTak is degraded and not adhering.

Try a fresh sheet of buildtak or cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and moving the print to a different location. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, low-quality filament or filament stored in very high humidity may not stick well.

Regarding your questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does lowering the temperature help? Raising it?&lt;/strong&gt; : Yes, lowering the temperature can help. I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point. Not only does this help with potential over extrusion, but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool (refer to the link above). &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, this could cause clogging if your temperature is too low. Keep an eye on your drive gear to see if there is too much friction while at lower temperatures. Increasing may keep the drive gear from &quot;eating&quot; your filament.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help?&lt;/strong&gt; : I prefer to print slower, most of the time, to allow the material to cool a bit more to avoid curling/warping (I primarily print with ABS, so it matters more). You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed. Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up, bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values. This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done. Again, I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing. This can be especially helpful with overhangs when paired with lowering your nozzle temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter, or layer height help&lt;/strong&gt; - I assume that extrusion diameter equals layer height (not difference in nozzle diameter, aka swapping nozzles). I'm not completely sure, but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings. For me, MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height, so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion. I would think that in general, a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width. This would be helpful when printing overhangs, but may not be helpful when printing bridges (a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps, please comment if you need more information/clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" LastActivityDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" CommentCount="4" />

A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand.

This made engineering and safety certification much easier, and completely eliminated mains-voltage wiring inside the printer, which is a big safety plus.

For a device like a 3D printer, I don't like the idea that of my axes can accumulate up to ±0.16 in. of error over 100 pitches (the pitch is between 0.12 in. and 0.25 in. so that is 12 to 25 in.). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to a belt where the only way you have a cumulative error is if you skip a tooth and I think the winner is the GT2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the non-cumulative pitch error both products are comparable but again the belt wins. For the Synchromesh we have an accuracy of ±0.002 in. versus ±0.0003(1) in. for a 2 mm GT2 belt and ±0.0012(1) in. for a 3 mm GT2 belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I can't be certain about exact values for error since there are no numbers for the GT2 - only a stupid chart. I also have a hard time believing that error is not a function of total length for both the Synchromesh and the GT2 belt but I'm not the manufacturer. However, since both products are made by the same company I wouldn't be as concerned about them trying to oversell one product over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, I don't see of any reason to choose a Synchromesh over a belt if your physical layout is compatible with both.

The two-rod-plus-screw arrangement is quite over-constrained and thus requires good alignment to move smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some basic troubleshooting steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure the screw is not constrained at both ends. It is very difficult to manufacture a screw that is perfectly straight and then mount it so precisely that it can rotate with zero runout. Screws in light-duty linear motion applications should be allowed to &quot;wobble&quot; freely so any bend or runout doesn't apply side-load forces to the Z stage. This can be accomplished by putting a misalignment-tolerant coupler (like an Oldham coupler) on the driven end, and/or leaving the non-driven end free without any support bearing. A motor mount with a small amount of compliance (like a rubber stepper damper) can help when the screw is captive to the motor. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lubricate the screw and bearings and make sure everything is clean and in good condition. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allow the Z carriage to self-align the rods and screw. The proper technique for this will depend on the Z stage, but the basic idea is to loosen the rod and screw mounts on either end, run the Z carriage back and forth a few times to push the rods into position, and then only re-tighten the top and bottom hardware when the carriage is at that end. It may also be necessary to loosen the screw nut and bearings on the carriage to get everything aligned properly and smooth-running, but that does not enforce parallelism like loosening the rod and screw mounts, so is really a secondary step. It may be necessary to leave some &quot;float&quot; in one rod or the bearings on one rod (with gravity preloading out any resultant slop) if the hardware has major alignment issues. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the stage still binds after doing the above, it may be necessary to check if the linear hardware is bent (such as by rolling rods on a flat table) or use a file or Dremel to loosen up the mounts or whatever feature is causing the misalignment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-11T20:02:00.360" CommentCount="0" />

One motor running at higher current will generally out-perform two motors splitting one driver's current via parallel wiring, because one motor with twice the torque can push much harder when one side of the gantry binds up or hits a rough spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only real downside to the single motor, double screw approach is that it requires more engineering and parts. A closed-loop timing belt must be run between the two screws, with associated pulleys, tensioner, and support bearings. In comparison, using a separate motor for each screw is very simple. It adds a stepper and a shaft coupler, but saves a lot of vitamins and design complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two-motor, two-screw solutions are lower-cost and simpler to design.

The passive side of the Z mechanism does add a little bit of stability to the X stage, but not a lot. It's possible to rack the X stage out of square with the bed and bind up the gantry. In order to work at all, they require a very wide/tall bearing footprint on the driven side to resist torque exerted on the driven side by the weight of the X stage and extruder carriage. So it's true that they don't have synchronization issues, but additional design challenges and undesirable flexure modes are introduced. It's much more common for one-screw designs to simply cantilever out the X stage, like a SmartRap or Printrbot Simple. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-12T03:38:48.547" CommentCount="2" />

Consider to use a shoe with a flat insole, perhaps even what is commonly called a flip-flop. If your objective is to perfectly match the curve of her foot bottom, this should work. Apply a layer of polymer modeling clay, plasticine or similar material. It should be warm enough to permit her foot/feet to settle in and push enough material away to remove any voids. If voids appear, one could then add a few blobs and repeat the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously some will ooze from the sides, which will have to be trimmed away. Trim a sufficient amount to fit her regular shoes and you'll have a reasonable match of the necessary fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resulting shape can then be scanned with a 3d scanner and converted to a 3d model. Even if the clay is excessively thick, the typical 3d model editor can slice away the excess, although one would have to make an almost arbitrary judgement for the location of the slicing plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option comes to mind. There are various silicone molding products. I've used one from makeyourownmolds.com that is of a consistency of frosting.

Another product sold at the local HobbyLobby is a similar molding compound that is more akin to the modeling clay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both compounds will release easily from skin, are non-toxic and would provide a more durable model from which to scan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one difficulty you may have is how to determine the correct foot pressure and posture to achieve the desired results. The modeling clay would give you more support and probably be more accurate. If your objective is to provide the same support as a bare foot, the silicone molding method would be more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stretch the concept even further, once you have the silicone or clay mold, you would be able to use the pin-art concept.

A 3D printer extruder is very, very hot, and will easily exceed the ratings of many typical silicone glues in normal service or during a runaway event. (You should always plan for an eventual thermal runaway. They're alarmingly common with cheap kit printers.) Even high-temp glues will not survive the temperatures an extruder can reach at full power if the firmware locks up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muffler putty is popular for fixing thermistors because it's one of the few widely-available ways of attaching a thermistor that will easily withstand the heat. In fact, it will survive after the aluminum hot block melts. (Yes, that can happen.) But muffler putty is fairly brittle, and has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from aluminum, so there is some risk of the thermistor detaching over time. I really don't recommend puttying thermistors used in extruders -- many people do, but it's less robust and less secure for long-term use than the proper hardware fixing methods found in modern hot block designs like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://e3d-online.com/Spares/v6-Heater-Block-and-Fixings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;E3Dv6&lt;/a&gt;.

Cleaning the tray should be done also per manufacturer's spec, although each printer's user forum may provide better or more effective options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus Touch has a caution regarding dripping resin on the mirrors, so there's operational care considerations for these types of printers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a build platform for these printers. The flatness and level are as critical or more so for resin printers, as the resolution can be astonishingly high. If any portion of a print does not bond to the platform, that entire print will have a failed section, creating an entirely failed print. Gravity is not particularly helpful in that respect, at least with the Pegasus Touch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The release medium varies from device to device. The Pegasus Touch originally used PDMS (silicon release compound) and now uses what's called a SuperVat. The plastic material in the SuperVat is purported to provide better release and fewer failures, along with increased lifespan. PDMS becomes cloudy from repeated printing in the same location and can be torn away from the vat if the print does not properly release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've become aware of a product from Australia that has had good reports from use in a B9 Creator resin printer. The report indicates that it releases the model quite easily and barely turns cloudy. I have an order pending for this material, as I am hopeful it will perform as described.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanics are also varied. One expects a system to raise and lower the build platform and to direct the laser or illumination system (DLP), but generally, this type of printer is somewhat simpler mechanically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because I live in a hot humid climate, my Pegasus Touch remains in the box, and my brain is about to explode with what I've learned of using it. Environmental conditions are likely to vary with different machines. I've seen references that 70 degrees F is too cold, others that say 70-75 degrees F is just fine, anything higher is too hot. Another user says that 65 degrees is good. The type of resin also becomes an important factor for environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The laser will create heat in the resin, so I'm inclined to believe that cooler is better. Different colors require different durations of laser light, somewhat akin to various plastics having different temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;supports and overhangs are important considerations in an SLA or DLP printer, just as they are in FDM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Expect also that many of the resin printers require that the user purchase only the product provided by the manufacturer.

(There are workarounds here like floating a layer of resin on brine, but these have their own technical issues.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you leave the resin in the printer for an extended period, you'll probably find a hardened layer on the surface from stray light exposure and have to clean out or replace the vat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resin vats/tanks need to be kept clean and free of cured resin debris from failed prints or stray light. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every combination of resin chemistry, printer light source, and printer optics requires specific tuning to dial in the photopolymer curing behavior. This means it's somewhat difficult to change resin brands, and you may effectively be locked into the printer manufacturer's resin. Many light sources will change in intensity or develop dim regions over time as they age, which will either harm print quality, require period recalibration, or require frequent light source replacement. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a limited number of options for print materials. Technology here is advancing rapidly, but for the most part, SLA/DLP prints are non-load-bearing models with a limited range of color options. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some pretty significant &quot;user experience&quot; downsides compared to a consumer desktop FDM printer. It's more hazard, more work, and more cost than FDM. SLA/DLP is primarily advantageous where high resolution or high print speeds are required. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-21T15:36:43.037" CommentCount="0" />

This may lead to clogging or skipping depending on how hot your extruder is at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, you can perform a Boolean subtract on your model of the section that's already printed and re-slice the model to print the remaining bit.

So, if the value is incremental and depending on the controller, this value could be lost or corrupt if a new print is initialized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would hope, that if you're using a slicing engine's &lt;em&gt;custom G-Code&lt;/em&gt; input, that the software would be able to compensate situations like this and reformat your provided G-Code to match the value of &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; or any similar command.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="115" LastEditDate="2016-05-19T07:12:01.727" LastActivityDate="2016-05-19T07:12:01.727" CommentCount="5" />

That assembly requires simplification to enable it to be downsized to allow for the printer output to reach closer to the perimeter of the output area, but the weight &amp;amp; bulk of the assembly is greater than any DLP projector that would take its place so this system can reliably perform with a heavier projector if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I think I'm looking for a software-defined method of coordinating the X &amp;amp; Y movement of the projector's output to the printing surface (presumable a tray of photo-sensitive SLA resin).  Since the projector's proximity to the printing surface must remain relatively close, the output will be constrained to an area significantly smaller than this platform's entire printable surface, the projector's output will have to &quot;play a movie&quot; of the model and instead of projecting still images, I believe it would require an animated output that exposes the resin to build models.

My printer is set up with a relatively long Bowden tube (500-600mm). I wonder if I need to push my retraction setting slightly beyond 2mm to take up some of the slack. Is the 2mm a conservative rating (I guess they don't want dissatisfied customers with clogging problems) or is it really the maximum? Is there anything else I can do to improve retraction performance?

The reason for the recommendation is that jams will occur with most all-metal hot ends if you pull molten filament up into the cold zone. Any molten filament that enters the cold zone rapidly cools and hardens and sticks to the walls, very often forming a jam. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the requirement is to keep your retraction distance &lt;em&gt;at the extruder&lt;/em&gt; less than 2mm. Additional retraction travel that is absorbed by the Bowden tube and not seen at the extruder is fine. I personally run 2.5mm retraction on an E3Dv6 Bowden system without any issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-30T00:15:10.073" CommentCount="2" />

  <row Id="944" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="938" CreationDate="2016-04-06T19:03:40.017" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene is a bear to print. There's a good reason almost nobody does it. The main problem is that it's a semi-crystalline material, which means it doesn't follow the normal rules for warping prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An amorphous polymer like ABS or PET is able to slowly flow or creep until it cools below the glass point, Tg. This means the stresses caused by thermal contraction will &quot;shake out&quot; above Tg and only start accumulating when the print cools below Tg and fully solidifies. That's why heated build plates are usually set around the glass point for amorphous materials -- there's minimal warping stress in the print at that temp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when you extrude semi-crystalline polymers like PE or PP, crystallization starts as soon as the temp drops below the melt point, Tm. A crystalline polymer will not flow or creep at a rate that is meaningful over the duration of an FDM print, so thermal contraction stresses will simply build up more and more as the plastic is cooled farther below Tm. And there's a loooong way to go when cooling from Tm to room temp. As a result, you get HUGE warping stresses with these plastics compared to more typical FDM materials. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is simply not possible to pick a heated bed or heated chamber temp that entirely eliminates the tendency of PP to warp. The normal rules we use for amorphous polymers don't apply. And, greatly compounding the problem, PP is a very low-surface-energy material with adhesion behavior fairly similar to wax. It doesn't want to stick to much of anything except itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High warping stress + poor adhesion = bad times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the simple answer is, polypropylene does not have the correct polymer behavior to be favorable for FDM. You will always be fighting warping. Think carefully about whether you want to struggle with PP or switch to a more suitable material that could accomplish the same design goal for the printed part. Do you really need to use PP? PET blends have similar hardness and chemical resistance, nylon blends have similar toughness, and TPUs can handle living hinge applications. That covers most of the reasons you'd want to use PP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must use PP, you're going to need to pull out ALL the tricks people use with traditional high-warp materials like ABS and PC and nylon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a build plate made of a close relative of the material you're printing. For example, people have successfully printed HDPE on a PP build plate, so I would imagine that a HDPE build plate should work for PP. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or, use a perfboard build plate with a raft so the initial layer will get embedded into the holes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or, use a coarse fibrous surface like stiff cardboard or fiberboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get the build chamber enclosed and as hot as you can without damaging the printer. 50C is usually reasonable for motors, extruders, etc unless you have PLA printed parts to worry about. (Heated build plates only really help with the bottom 5-10mm of the print if the printer is not enclosed.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use helper disks / mouse ears on corners.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Really mash the first layer down onto the build plate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print low layer heights, like 0.1mm. Smaller layers mean the thermal contraction applies more shear stress between layers, and less of the large-scale aggregate bending stress that lifts corners. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Higher print speeds may also help due to some complex strain-crystallization effects, but that's only currently proven in nylon to my knowledge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option, if it meets your functional requirements, is to use a fiberglass or carbon fiber composite PP. CFR and GFR plastics usually warp less than virgin plastics. The fibers have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which makes the composite material contract less as it cools, which reduces warping stress. The most successful PP printing I've ever seen was GFR-PP. But that stuff is hard to find and may not work if the part needs to be flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T19:03:40.017" CommentCount="1" />

You really just need to keep everything a little bit &quot;wet&quot; with oil or grease and performance will be adequate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main downside to using grease with sintered bushings is that they will likely stop being &quot;self-lubricating&quot; after the first exposure. The grease tends to clog the pores that allow the sintered bushings' factory oil impregnation to maintain a nice oil film on the sliding surfaces. So the bushings will forever-after require regular re-greasing, just like the ball bearings and threaded rod. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a light machine oil like 3-in-one will maintain the sintered bushings' self-lubricating properties, but if used in ball bearings and screws will require very frequent replenishment. And that is certainly an option -- oil DOES work on bearings and screws -- but odds are good that you'll eventually over-oil the bearings, get drips on the build plate, and bang your head against a wall trying to figure out why your prints won't stick all of a sudden. Grease doesn't need to be applied as often, and it tends to stay where you put it rather than dripping. So grease is generally preferred to oil if you have to pick just one lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the most important thing is to keep sliding and rolling surfaces wet with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. You'll just have various maintenance trade-offs with different options. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T19:14:12.270" CommentCount="1" />

It's trial and error. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The temp number your printer reports really doesn't matter. That's just a process control variable: it needs to be consistent and repeatable, but it doesn't need to be accurate against an independent reference. What you should care about is your print results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some signs your printing temp is too cold:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA printed parts have a dull, matte surface&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Poor layer adhesion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Extruder stalls or strips the filament at fairly low printing speeds for your extruder and nozzle size&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some signs your printing temp is too hot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA printed parts have a very shiny surface&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA has a very strong sugary/waffle smell, or any material smells burnt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stringiness during travel moves that you can't eliminate by tuning retraction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Excessive oozing while the nozzle is stationary off the print&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bubbles or cloudiness in extruded strands in extruded strands even with dry filament&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will also calibrate speeds via trial and error. There are two main speed limits for a printer: how fast the motion mechanism can move the nozzle without running into issues or unacceptable print quality degradation (which is also a function of acceleration settings), and how fast the hot end can heat up and melt filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism speed limits you have to find via trial and error. Pick a test print you like (such as Benchy) and repeat it with different tuning until you find your preferred limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Melt flow restrictions are slightly more complex, because they are a function of VOLUME flow rate, not commanded speeds. Make a large boxy test print (with long straight lines) and multiply extrusion width times layer height times feedrate. That will give you your approximate flow rate in mm^3/sec. Generally speaking, every extruder + hot end + material combo will have a maximum feasible flow rate. For example, most &quot;average&quot; hobbyist printers with 0.4mm nozzles and good extruders can extrude about 4-8 mm^3/sec with PLA. PTFE-lined hot ends are at the lower end, all-metal hot ends are at the higher end. The value will depend on your hardware. But you can do a few quick benchmarking tests to find the limit, and then use that to determine peak feedrates to avoid exceeding the melt capacity of your system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-11T21:45:51.913" CommentCount="6" />

This will be the main body of your 'screw'.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To make the thread, you need to create a helix primitive. You can edit the number of coils and the coil thickness in the Maya GUI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you have the thread, it is a simple matter of performing a couple of boolean operations. The first boolean (union) operation will unite the screw made in step 1 with the thread made in step 2. The second boolean (subtract) operation will cut out the thread from the object within which you want your screw to be driven into. When you print the two models, you should find that the screw nicely turns into the object from which you cut out the thread.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is: yes, it is easy to do such things in most 3D software packages. Maya comes with a nice selection of default objects you can use, so essentially you need to do no 'modeling' yourself to create something like the example you showed us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your next question, about editing models on Thingiverse. The reason why you cannot edit them easily is because most models there have been decimated and triangulated, which makes them very difficult to reshape or edit because the topology is no longer strictly manifold -- it is just a big mess of triangles! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit Thingiverse models, I recommend something like ZBrush. You can import triangulated models and then rebuild the geometry into quads (using DynaMesh, for example), which you can then edit to your liking. Once done, you can simply decimate and re-export as STL or whatever extension you need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, low/high poly is not so relevant in 3D print outs, especially in mechanically functioning parts. This is because most models are created in high resolution (high polygon count) and then decimated + triangulated down to truncate file sizes. But the functionality and physical feel of the model should not change due to this process - it just takes practice and lots of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hassan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1416" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T02:01:12.807" CommentCount="0" />

This certainly does not require absolute accuracy of the temperature sensors(*) or the use of ideal filament to achieve.  In your slicing program it should be possible to &lt;em&gt;increment&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;alter&lt;/em&gt; the parameters - like 'flow rate' or 'printing temperature' &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; a print of a simple shape - in such a way that is is possible to make subjective comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some enthusiast videos detail a method of using a slicer program to print a simple hollow column and to increment a particular parameter from say 90% to 110% of the &quot;ideal&quot; values in fixed steps every 5 mm in the Z direction.  One can then observe the output and make a subjective determination of the print quality along the length of the column, and adopt the parameter value associated with the position in Z that produced the &quot;best&quot; outcome in terms of finish, strength and layer adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A standard plugin for the free slicer program &quot;Cura&quot; called &quot;TweakAtZ&quot; allows one to generate such a script, and could be a good option even if you normally would use a different slicer.  A user on the youtube site (with which I have no association) detailed this approach in a video titled &quot;How to Find the Perfect Print Settings For Your 3D Printer&quot;.

If absolutely necessary it would probably best be done with a small gauge wire twisted Type &quot;T&quot; thermocouple wire tip inserted directly into the extruder nozzle if possible.

The cold zone needs to be cool for the extruder to work right. It looks like the cold zone is not staying below the glass point of the plastic, so the filament softens and mashes into a jam. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some common causes of jamming in Replicator 2 extruders:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Printer's environment is too hot. If it's in a hot garage, move it indoors. If you have it inside an enclosure or cabinet, open it up to let it breathe. All-metal extruders with PLA are very sensitive to ambient temp. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not having good contact between the heatsink and the cooling bar. Normally, just bolting them together is fine, but a small amount of of thermal grease (like Arctic Silver) smeared over the contact surface can help too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not having the fan pointed the right way. You want the fan to blow ONTO the heatsink: this provides more turbulent flow and better cooling. This means you should not see the fan sticker when everything is assembled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fan dying and and spinning too slow. A new fan can be a good idea. (24v fans only!) Or you can try gently peeling off the fan sticker and adding a single drop of light oil (like 3-in-one) to the bearing, then re-attaching the sticker.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using non-stock thermal barrier tubes that do not have the correct internal geometry. Lots of people sell bad tubes that don't have the &quot;secret sauce&quot; (internal diameter step). The four good vendors I'm aware of for this part are Makerbot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.raffle.ch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Carl Raffle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micro-swiss.com/#!product-page/cv9c/486618f3-3e55-0d63-e3b0-f94eb2277b58&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Micro Swiss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.p3-d.com/collections/replacements-parts/products/thermal-barrier-tubes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Performance 3D&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Floating&quot; the thermal barrier threads by tightening jam nuts on both top and bottom of the cooling bar. All-metal extruder designs require good contact pressure between the thermal barrier tube threads and the cooling bar, to ensure maximum heat transfer. The best approach is to put one jam nut below the bar to forcibly push the thermal barrier tube threads into the cooling bar, and no nut on top. (Using just one nut on top is better than two nuts, but worse than one nut below.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that there is some material partially blocking the nozzle, which is contributing to molten plastic backup up and jamming. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I would recommend right now is removing both the nozzle and thermal barrier tube from the printer, and either replacing them or fully cleaning them out. There are multiple options. You can preheat the hot end with the cooling bar in a vise or on a metal surface with no fans attached, to heat up the plastic in the thermal barrier tube and allow you to push the blockage through with a small allen key. Then do something to REALLY clean it out, like nylon cold-pulls, or cooking the parts in a blue flame such as a torch or gas stove. Then check for internal debris with something like a toothpick. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you can see through the nozzle orifice and there's no junk inside anything, reassemble everything properly and try again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-24T13:23:58.143" CommentCount="0" />

When a slicing engine slices a 3D model, it's goal is to spit out the preferred machine paths in G-Code (of some kind). However, I've read a few articles, done some tests, and heard through the grape vine that anywhere between 10%-35% is good enough for most applications. I once watched a webinar for understanding the new MakerWare interface that explained how they chose such settings. Although I can't find the clip directly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makerbot.com/resources/webinars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the page for all of MakerBot's webinars.

Beyond 35% and you're going to want to reconsider how you're orienting the print when you print it and what you're printing to utilize the grain structure for proper strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, infill percentage/patterns are not the only variable for creating strong parts. Infill is really just a way to save time and material. Here are some other ways to potentially increase strength:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase your shell. Shell is the number of profile patterns per layer. Typically (in FDM/FFF), each shell is &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; the diameter of your extruder nozzle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase your floor/roof. Similar to shell, floor/roof refers to the number of layers that make up the &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot; of the part with regard to the build plate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print orientation. Pay attention to which areas of the part are susceptible to strain along the &quot;grain&quot; of the layers. Try to rotate your part on the build plate in a way that minimizes potential failure both in print and post-print use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post process. Don't be afraid to do some post-processing to increase the strength. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://markforged.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some 3D printers on the market&lt;/a&gt; that go as far as including Kevlar strands in the printing process to beef up their prints. However, it may be as simple as just coating the part in an epoxy with some basic finishing techniques. It's a bit more work, but it turns weak 3D printed parts into full production quality prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Based on some of the comments, it sounds like your best bet might be to find a custom application that can either convert the g-code file into a solid model (try CAM software?), or create a plugin for your CAD software (I know Unigraphics NX and Solidworks allow for this) and essentially recreate your own slicing engine that takes your solid model and generates the same infill pattern dynamically inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps look into the works of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simlab-soft.com/index.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Simlab&lt;/a&gt; or similar which has a lot of 3D software plugins.

The bars should not only vary in infill percentages, but in also the various infill patterns.

This is especially important with ABS when it comes to shrinkage, warping, and delayering. In order for the part to be universally as strong as possible, as the part cools, it must shrink evenly. This is a well known factor for machinists creating molds for injection molding and casting. Otherwise, you may have unintended additional points of weaknesses arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if creating tensile bars, make sure to take into account the shrinkage experienced along each axis, for each individual example. I would also suggest cutting each one open, as well as attempting to break a few of the apart (in a very crude way).

And to accelerate and decelerate a motor under load, you need to finely vary their timing.  Back when I/O ports hung directly off processor buses, and operating systems could not prevent programs from speeding up the system hardware timer in order to run a stepper routine rapidly, this worked to a degree.  But today:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most PC class processors have little, if any directly coupled I/O - especially by the time you get outside the box.  An interface like USB is great for moving a large amount of data per unit time, but it is absolutely horrible for accomplishing a trivial task with precise, frequent timing - it is a freight train, not a bicycle courier.  Many of the things which let a processor internally operate quickly specifically work by decoupling it from an outside world that often cannot keep up - memory caches, bus exchange units, etc.  If you do find a parallel port today, it is likely to be on the far side of a PCI bus bridge at the least, and have a different low-level interface than a legacy one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern operating systems have a time-slice scheduler which &quot;owns&quot; the CPU(s) and hands out small chunks of processing time to ordinary programs.  These programs typically get to run often enough to appear responsive to the user, but not frequently enough to accurately drive stepper motors.  There are various schemes which have been tried, for example to create a &quot;hard real time&quot; scheduler which owns the processor, and allows a motor control task to register for precisely needed time slices - then, with whatever time is left over a Linux or Windows or similar kernel is allowed to run, and divide up the remaining time among ordinary programs through its scheduling rules.  Of course, such a scheme tends to need to be revised each time the utilized conventional operating system has a new major release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there are ways around these issues, they tend to require atypical hardware and deep changes to the operating system installation - making them neither inexpensive nor easy to setup for end users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is generally simpler and more cost effective (not even $10 these days) to put an embedded processor on an external circuit board, and have it act as a delegate to execute precise-timing tasks on behalf of the host processor.  Somewhat extending from the idea of industrial CNC machines that originally read punched paper tape, and were later updated with a scheme where an ordinary computer &quot;drip feeds&quot; G-code commands over a serial port, modern 3D Printers tend to deliver G-code (or other) command data a little bit in advance of when it is needed, so that the latency of a USB or serial connection doesn't really matter.  Normally enough data is buffered on the printer for it to keep running, but even if not it would only pause briefly between the complete moves which are transmitted, not experience motor stuttering as it would if the USB were trying to deliver each individual step pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for why an Arduino - probably mostly the history of who built the machines which kicked off the enthusiast printing trend.  If someone from an industrial background were tasked with building something like an FDM printer or a machine with similar motion needs in isolation today, chances are they would end up with an ARM processor that would be a bit faster, more flexible, and with more resources, and likely cost a little less.  But in actual history, the early affordable machines were built by those in maker community, who were already familiar with the availability of the Arduino, and willing to put some cleverness into getting good motion out of its limitations.  RAMPS in particular seems designed to be a coarse-pitch through-hole bridge that a hobbyist could build themselves, and then buy the slightly trickier to work with surface mount processor and motor drive chips preassembled in the form of an Arduino Mega and stepper drive modules.  That even fairly propriety machines maintain these basic parts choices is probably an indication of the utility of not &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; - if you want to develop a printer, you can start from available components and customize them only one by one as you choose, rather than not being able to run your development prototype until you get a working circuit board designed and fabbed, a working software base developed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1378" LastEditorUserId="1378" LastEditDate="2016-05-03T15:46:29.070" LastActivityDate="2016-05-03T15:46:29.070" CommentCount="0" />

The underlying machine code can write an entire byte to set the status of all 8 pins at once. So in principle, all the step pins on the RAMBO board can be triggered exactly simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Arduino IDE hides this behavior from firmwares by abstracting the port's byte handling as a function call for each individual pin. That means programmers only have to know the Arduino PIN number, not which port and position on the processor is being used. And then the modern firmwares typically used by RAMBO do a further layer of abstraction to make it easy for the same firmware to be used by different boards, by changing pin assigned names in a config file (usually pins.h) and not assuming any specific port selection was made during board design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no guarantee for open-source firmware that a particular pin selection was made in hardware. Lots of 3D printer controller boards even have pretty dumb pin assignments, like using hardware-PWM-capable pins for stepper signals rather than PWM'd heaters. Marlin and Repetier have chosen flexibility over performance optimization in this regard. They pretty much let the board designer use any pin for anything. When they have to do stuff like run heater PWM control or fire a bunch of step pulses as fast as possible, they emulate that in software rather than taking advantage of specific hardware that isn't always available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this specific case, there may not actually be all that much performance gain/loss. Writing to an output pin is pretty fast. The amount of time difference between firing a few step pulses in sync or firing them sequentially is on the order of a few microseconds. That won't make any difference to the motion fidelity of the printer's physical drivetrains.

Here's a few things to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is your extruder temperature appropriate for the material? Typical printing temperatures can range anywhere from 200-225c for PLA (depending on the supplier). Often, if the extruder is too hot, the material will bubble or over extrude.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the material of proper quality? There's a reason MakerBot Industries wants you to use their filament (besides putting their hands in your pocket book), and that is repeatability. They've tested their filament on their hardware and ensured that the material will extrude with regular print settings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the material being stored properly? Sometimes people forget to store PLA in a dry place to avoid absorbing moisture in the filament. If moisture is absorbed, it can perform poorly in the print. Indications of moisture can include a slight steam from the extruder and/or bubbles in the extruded material (similar to over heating).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are the fans operating correctly? If the fans aren't running or aren't running enough, the filament begins to heat further up the extrusion assembly (closer to the drive gear) which can inhibit extrusion. I know that MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop has been updated lately with more emphasis on controlling fans for active cooling, so make sure that your fan(s) are operating for duration of the print as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All and all, your filament is getting too hot. If you can't determine the sudden change, consider printing with a lower extruder temperature from now on. However, if you're using MakerBot filament (or similar quality) then I would definitely verify that your machine is calibrated, wires are fully connected, and settings are double checked. If all is as expected, then you should call MakerBot support (since they're closed source now, they technically have an obligation to help you) especially since the machine is so new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-05-02T05:05:16.313" CommentCount="1" />

Now, to figure out a solution...&#xA;Take a look at the image below.  There is a 1 inch tube that goes from the heat element to the heat sink.  This 1 inch of tubing is REALLY hot and larger than 1.75mm.  So, the filament goes through that tube on its way to the head and gets soft in the tube because the tube is so hot all the way down to the head.  When the filament gets hot, it melts and bends and curls which makes it NOT push itself into the heated tip and out onto whatever I'm printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution would be to find some way to cool this 1 inch shaft between the heat sink and the heated head so that the filament inside of it won't melt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any ideas??? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hFkPM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hFkPM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Extruder Assembly&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of my heat tip.

It's the shape of the lowest energy possible in your situation. Simple but it doesn't explain the issue... or does it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does. The filament cannot be put into the extruder as it becomes plugged. This leads us to some obvious explanations. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/904/teflon-tubing-in-nozzle-throat-coming-out/906#906&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how is that possible that there is enough room to form such corkscrew? My bet is you don't have teflon pipe inside the extruder heatsink. So filament goes into the heatsink and everything is ok until the heatsink itself warms up to the temperature when filament becomes soft, then there is no enough force to push the filament out of the nozzle so above the nozzle filament bends and forms the shape of the lowest energy as said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Options to check:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take your extruder apart. See if there is a teflon pipe. If its length is proper. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check if cooling fan is working well, if it's pushing air to the heatsing but not sucks from the heatsink.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[edit]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking closer to your photos I'm pretty sure you don't have such teflon pipe.

Delamination or edge/corner cracking is caused by warping stresses when the first layer adhesion is stronger than the interlayer bonding. Or it happens when the heated build plate allows a strong non-warping foundation to be built until the print is too tall to be adequately warmed by the plate. In either case, the corners of the first layer can't lift, so the print cracks elsewhere to relieve the stress. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All ABS warping stress, in turn, is caused by the repeated thermal contraction of the fresh plastic layer at the top of the print. The FDM process sticks hot, expanded plastic onto cool, contracted plastic. When the new layer cools, it tries to contract, but it's stuck to a layer that is already fully cooled/contracted. This generates a large shear stress between the two layers. The accumulation of those shear stresses over many consecutive layers generates a large-scale bending force on the entire print. That's what causes both warping and delamination. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZZam.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZZam.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The less the previous layer cools below the glass point of the plastic, the less thermal contraction it experiences before the next layer goes down, and therefore the less warping stress will accumulate as the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; layer cools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Environment temp is the biggest thing you can control:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your printer's environment is below 35C, you probably shouldn't even bother printing ABS. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A 50C environment is significantly better and will have minimal problems with warping and delamination. This is within the ambient temp ratings of most motors and electronics. Air-cooled extruders can typically extrude ABS reliably up to about 60C ambient, at which point they may be prone to clogging. And don't forget about plastic structural parts in your printer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Industrial ABS printers with heated build chambers print ABS in a 75-85C environment, with lots of airflow. In terms of cooling regimes, ABS in an 80C chamber acts very similar to PLA in a room-temp environment. No warping, but lots of airflow required for good detail. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing ABS at a higher nozzle temperature (say 240-250C) will also improve layer adhesion so delamination is less likely to occur. The same warping stresses will be there, but the layer bonding may be stronger than the internal stresses in the part so it survives printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-05-03T19:13:39.337" LastActivityDate="2016-05-03T19:13:39.337" CommentCount="1" />

Please be aware that printing a object is yet not as easy as printing on paper. The machines that print 3D are more like industrial machines than that they are like your inkjet printer at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the curious beginner I would suggest to  first concentrate on modelling and printing technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Modeling&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can of course download things from ThingyVerse or YouMagine but you might be more interested in &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; things than printing them. I don't know Windows 10 3D design. I personally find Sketchup Modeling software a good entry-point because they have a large set of video tutorials and while you learn you can add more complicated extensions to the program. There are also extensions that help you make your model 'watertight' and 'ready for print'.&#xA;Of course you can find heaps of tutorials on Youtube for other modeling software like freeCAD or Fusion but you might find it a bit overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Printing&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As suggested in the comments, you could start with letting your objects print by others. It's worth to set aside a small budget for that.&#xA;They easiest to design for is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shapeways.com/additive-manufacturing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SLS printing&lt;/a&gt;. You don't have to worry about overhangs etc. Buying a SLS printer is not an option but you can have it print at multiple printingfarms like Shapeways.&#xA;You soon enough find out that making a print 'light' and hollow will save a lot of cash. Shapeways will tell you if there is anything wrong with your design too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit harder is FDM printing where layers of threads are stacked. Because overhangs need support, most of the time extra plastic is printed that has to be removed later.  Plastic is not expensive and insides can be printed hollow, so cost is not so much a thing you have to worry about when designing.&#xA;On 3Dhubs you can find experienced people who own a printer and want to print for you. They can tell you what is printable and what not. If you have a hub near you this is a good option to get familiar with the technique.&#xA;If you did that a couple of times you can decide to go to a fablab or makerspace where you lent/rent a printer. Make yourself familiar with slicing software like Cura before you go. There are many settings like for filling the space in the object and for making support for parts that 'hang in the air'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you buy a printer you probably print mostly with PLA and ABS and all printers can print that.&#xA;Even when you own a printer you might sometimes want to print a part at Shapeways because of the material options or to make something that is impossible to print. &#xA;3DHubs gives you the possibility to experiment with a large range of printer and materials. Print quality though is often influenced by the experience level of the person printing it so don't deside what printer to buy on these results. 3DHubs has a good printer-guide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having a printer yourself makes it a lot easier and more fun to print objects you have downloaded. Also, making something, seeing the result and then adjusting it, is a more organic way to learn and create designs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 3D printing ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1672" LastActivityDate="2016-05-05T10:11:27.210" CommentCount="0" />

They have a potentiometer which can be adjusted to make the position of the stop change without any mechanical intervention allowing very fine tuning. They can be very accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Optical are similarly accurate but usually have a fixed component that cuts the beam to switch on/off the sensor.

Meaning, both of these types of switches &lt;sup&gt;(generally)&lt;/sup&gt; provide a valuable range for object detection. This can potentially lead (depending on your machine) to a pushed command that tells your machine to slow down when it comes close to the soft stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, personally, I would be wary of using an optical endstop with potential white light noise from ambient room lighting or other sources. I could be wrong in my concern for some modules that address these kind of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if we narrow down between mechanical and magnetic:&#xA; - Magnetic would provide a gentler approach, reducing (potentially) the amount of wear&#xA; - However, I'm assuming, magnetic switches require &quot;dialing in&quot; depending on the components used in the sensor. This could lead to an undesired range that the sensor is triggered.&#xA; - Mechanical switches are simple. They're either touching or not touching (on or off)&#xA; - A possible pro (or con) is the ability to manipulate the trigger manually, more easily.

Nothing is gained by having, say, 0.001mm precision endstops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This precision of +/-0.01mm is achievable for all types of endstop switches, with proper switch selection and configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there are three &quot;standard&quot; switching types in use in consumer/hobbyist 3d printers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical switches, typically dual NO/NC limit switches, which either pull up or pull down a signal pin by connecting an electrical circuit when triggered&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Optical switches, which use transistors to detect when an obstacle (&quot;flag&quot;) is blocking the window between the emitter and sensor&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hall effect switches, which use transistors to detect when a magnetic field exceeds a particular field strength cutoff&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanical Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Precision/repeatability depends on the switch quality, length of lever arm attached (longer increases contact distance but is worse for precision), and impact speed of the carriage with the switch. It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch. This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small mechanical switch with a short lever arm (or the lever arm removed) will generally achieve the required +/-0.01mm switching precision. Very cheap switches, high contact speeds, and long lever arms may provide inadequate resolution for Z homing or probing, but will still be adequate for low-precision X and Y homing purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection. Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch: some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered. When not triggered, the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller, while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise. It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control. Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring. Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position. These will tend to reject noise better. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer. However, most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles, which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector. This is non-contact and can be quite reliable, but introduces some challenges. The exact trigger position (and thus precision) may depend on ambient light levels in the room, because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity. So it may be very repeatable/precise in the short term but have some drift if the sensor moves in and out of the sun through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Switching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side, rather than the top. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Optical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low, and thus have good electrical noise rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hall Effect Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity. This is highly precise/repeatable (better than +/-0.01mm) and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions. (Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields, anyway.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance. That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch. This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting, and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage. Glue works fine... but don't glue the magnet in place backwards!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-05-09T15:26:32.263" LastActivityDate="2016-05-09T15:26:32.263" CommentCount="6" />

The material becomes weaker and less dimensionally stable under load as the temperature approaches the glass point of the polymer. For example, here is some Stratasys test data for ABS strength versus temperature:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PN3QJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PN3QJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the plastic survives a few uses, it may creep and warp over time. And that might be fine, depending on your needs! People have printed working coffee cups out of ABS before. For some definition of &quot;working&quot; you can make print a working coffee mug. It's just not going to work at the level of longevity and reliability that people typically expect from hot beverage containers. (Imagine if the handle breaks and pours scalding liquid in your lap.) PLA in particular tends to give out abruptly due to its unusual ability to creep to ultimate failure with very low elongations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of whether ANY FDM printed part is ever safe for &lt;em&gt;repeated&lt;/em&gt; food service use. One-time uses (such as throw-away cookie cutters) might be perfectly fine, but repeated use introduces additional problems because FDM parts are porous. They contain a microscopic void/grain structure that is perfect for trapping food debris and sheltering bacteria. Every FDM part is similar in that regard to an old, scratched, wooden cutting board. They are difficult to effectively sanitize. A high-temp dishwasher cycle will do the job, but that imposes significant thermal stress on thermoplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example micrograph I took of voids in a printed part (strands all aligned the same way to highlight the shape):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfYtx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfYtx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These voids will also allow liquids to leak unless careful print settings are used. Over-extruding with multiple perimeters, or doing some kind of post-print sealing can make water-tight parts. It's not hard, just takes some experimenting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also considerable anecdotal evidence that much of the cheap filament from Asia is full of nasty, toxic substances that may leach into hot beverages. Heavy metals like lead, strontrium, and cadmium are often found in thermoplastics as processing aids, pigments, or simply from unscrupulous companies disposing of industrial ashes by mixing them into dark-colored filaments for export. US-made and EU-made filaments seem to be better in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that the basic issues are out of the way... Here is the breakdown of specific materials you might want to try:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA&lt;/strong&gt; blends used in 3d printing will soften and fail almost instantly on contact with hot beverages. (They contain melt-reducers and viscosity modifiers and polymer molecular weights specific to FDM filament and will perform differently from injection-molded PLA products.) It is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to anneal PLA to survive higher temperatures, as this increases the crystallinity of the polymer and thus makes it more heat-stable. However, that is highly experimental and results will vary considerably with filament provider, color/pigment, and annealing process used. Even annealed PLA is unlikely to survive long-term against very hot beverages and dishwasher use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABS&lt;/strong&gt; will become fairly weak at hot beverage temperatures. It may survive use for a while, but is quite weak and will slowly creep with very hot beverages or in a high-temp dishwasher. ABS IS approved for food use in many contexts, despite what many people think, but hot beverages are not one of the approved uses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PET&lt;/strong&gt; blends are chemically a pretty good choice -- soda bottles are PET -- but generally have glass points around 70-75C and thus will be weak or fail outright at hot beverage temperatures. It is also important to ask what is being blended into the PET. For example, PETG is &quot;glycol modified&quot; but filament vendors do not share any details about this or reveal how it may affect the polymer's leaching behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;nylons&lt;/strong&gt; will creep under load at surprisingly low temperatures, perhaps 50-55C depending on the blend. Nylons are also attacked by acids and will absorb stains and smells from coffee. Nylons also tend to swell/shrink quite dramatically on exposure to water, so mechanical fit and general shape of nylon parts may not be stable enough even for cold beverage service. &lt;strong&gt;Taulman's 910 is probably a good candidate for hot beverage service due to its high working temperature&lt;/strong&gt;, but acid attack from coffee exposure may still be an issue in the long run. It's worth trying. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycarbonate&lt;/strong&gt; is thermally stable even in boiling water, so mechanically it is fine, but PC leaches BPA (one of the monomers left over from manufacture) into hot liquids. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;High-temp exotics like Ultem and PEEK aren't printable by consumer/hobbyist printers at the size scale required for a coffee mug. They simply warp too much unless you have an oven for a heated build chamber. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make a working coffee mug via FDM printing, but it isn't a great idea. &lt;strong&gt;Your best bet for 3d printing a coffee mug is ordering ceramic printed from an online service bureau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-09T16:14:29.243" CommentCount="2" />

Either will work, but there are trade-offs involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Various considerations that may come into play:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A flat sheet of aluminum has better &lt;strong&gt;stiffness/weight ratio&lt;/strong&gt; than a flat sheet of steel. If weight/mass is a concern, such as with a Mendel style moving Y-bed, aluminum may be superior to an equivalent stiffness steel sheet. On the other hand, steel has the superior &lt;strong&gt;stiffness/thickness ratio&lt;/strong&gt;, so if the total thickness of the plate is constrained, such as by the printer's mounting hardware, steel may be higher performance. In short, for sheets of equivalent stiffness, aluminum will be thicker but lighter. That may or may not matter for your specific printer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Differential thermal expansion can be an issue, depending on what the plate is attached to. For example, rigidly bolting a steel sheet to an aluminum sub-frame will cause the structure to warp when its temperature changes. Likewise for bolting an aluminum sheet to a steel sub-frame. Bed mounts that &quot;float&quot; will not cause warping in either case. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All kinds of rolled sheet metal may have a tendency to warp when heated/cooled, due to residual stresses and grain alignment effects from manufacture. When people want extreme dimensional stability for the flattest and lowest-warp print bed possible, an aluminum cast tooling plate material such as MIC 6 is usually used. The MIC 6 sheet is then precision ground to be flat. Of course, that adds cost. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neither aluminum nor steel is a particularly good &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; print surface. Either will need some kind of adhesion layer, like Kapton tape or gluestick. The adhesion layer matters far more than the type of metal underneath.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aluminum sheets are often used as &lt;strong&gt;heat-spreaders&lt;/strong&gt; to even out the bed temperature of heated beds. This is very important when heaters are smaller than the total bed size, or have hot spots. (Most heaters do have hot spots.) Steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, so the surface of the bed will take longer to heat up and will be less even. That may or may not be an issue, depending on the printer and desired materials. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it's really a holistic design decision.

That screws up the extrusion volume. The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Measure actual average filament diameter and input that&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print a 100% infill calibration cubes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the print is over-extruded (top or sides bulging), decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again. If the print is under-extruded or looks clean, increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat as needed to dial it in. The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints. This produces minimum void volume and strong parts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the future, that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier. You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output. (And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter, you don't even really need to measure the diameter.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to measure perimeters, you can do 3 perimeters and divide the measurement by 3. That takes into account most of the overlap and will be much closer to accurate than a single-perimeter measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMPLETE ANSWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible (at least in the &quot;solid&quot; parts of the print like perimeters, roofs, and floors). Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength. In fact, voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses. Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges, they have to be &lt;strong&gt;overlapped&lt;/strong&gt; to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize &quot;corner voids.&quot; That looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the bulges overlap, the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; fill the voids. It's very difficult to get 100% packing density, but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap. That makes very weak prints and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get the right amount of strand overlap, the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it. This is not uniform between software packages. So it's important to understand what &quot;extrusion width&quot; means to different slicers. For a couple prominent examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slic3r treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands. Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;S3D treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the average width of the stack of strands, which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals. Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart. That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math. But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal &quot;width.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly, but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart. When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting = measured thickness, you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap. &lt;strong&gt;S3D's strands must measure wider than the &quot;width&quot; setting to get the correct overlap.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions, and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions. But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals. And that is only an accurate assumption when [extrusion width &gt; nozzle width + layer height]. The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section. So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary. The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands. Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to both systems. You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T17:31:57.253" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T17:31:57.253" CommentCount="3" />

The printer takes more time on more complicated layers.   If a you were able to print the same 1 inch, at .3mm layer height, it would be a total of  ~85 layers.  This would allow for ~42 seconds per layer.  Most layers would take longer from this (from personal experience).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the constant layer rate, multiple objects can also be printed at once because if the printer has to print the layer for the first object, it is not taking more time for it to cure resin in another location on the print bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, DLP printers can have much better resolutions than FDM printers.

Which is obvious as structure of the object should store construction of an object but not its position. So position is relation-to-something so to speak and because object itself doesn't contain any information about object environment then there is no position stored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is one hack. All coordinates stored inside object are in fact a realtion to some starting point. Let's say it's a zero-point or starting point of the coordinate system of the object. This is sometimes anoying because it's usually bottom left corner or center of the object. Unfortunately some applications store this starting point out of the object. This means that object has starting point in some point but this point is outside of the object itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This cause the situation when user loads an object in another application then object is translated in &quot;strange&quot; position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Position of the object in printing application.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When user loads an object into printing application then object is usualy set in the center of build plate. This also sounds obvious but if inner coordinate system of the object is translated then object can be repositioned even out of the build plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is the solution for such situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage object coordinate system in the application which create STL file  or convert object into STL format or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage (switch off) option called &quot;center on build plate&quot; or &quot;center on the bed&quot; or &quot;center object&quot; or &quot;auto-center parts&quot; in printing application.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it will be possible (or easier) to position object according to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is STL object which is in fact kinda assembly of separate objects.

But it does depend on the slicer and settings. Some slicers (like Slic3r) will auto-decimate toolpaths to ensure that the rate of motion commands isn't too difficult for the old, slow 8bit processors in most consumer/hobbyist 3d printers. Having a large number of very small motion commands can bog down these motion controllers and cause pause-stuttering that creates little zits on the print. Most slicers simply reduce model detail level to safeguard the motion controller. Because the contours are decimated to a minimum motion segment length, very small model triangles are irrelevant to printer performance. At the most, they might add a marginal amount of slicing time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some slicers (like Simplify3d) assume you have the correct level of detail you want in your model, and will pretty faithfully reproduce the model file's contours in the sliced toolpath. If your entire model is very high mesh density / poly count in general, or if your high-density mesh regions are crossed by a layer slice, this can produce a series of very, very short motion commands. Sometimes the motion commands are even smaller than the motion resolution of the printer, and simply take up processor time (to evaluate and drop from the queue) with no benefit to print fidelity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, high-poly models are dramatically more difficult for the 3d printer to reproduce accurately. There are two big issues: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each motion segment requires some processor time to read/receive, parse, and execute. But the shorter the segment lengths are, the faster the printer runs through them. A short move takes little time to perform but still has the same processor load as a long move. At a certain point, the processor can't keep up, and performance suffers. The printer may run out of queued moves to execute and pause in place, or it may violate acceleration limits and violently clunk through corners (or even lose position) because it didn't have enough time to iterate through the calculations that determine how fast it should move.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The algorithms used by most consumer/hobbyist 3d printer firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, Sailfish, Smoothieware, etc) are based on GRBL. And without getting into the math, GRBL uses the sharpness of the corners between motion segments to decide how fast to travel through the corner. So a 90 degree turn will trigger a considerable slowdown, while a series of small angles (such as many small segments comprising a curved surface) is not recognized by the algorithm, and it will try to barrel through the curve at full speed. On long, gentle curves, this is fine, but high-poly &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt; curves (such as a filleted edge or organic model detail) are traversed far too fast because no slowdowns are triggered. This means high-poly models must be printed at much lower feedrates / target speeds, because the acceleration algorithm can't figure out when to go fast or slow. Whereas a blocky, low-poly model can be printed much faster and the acceleration code will speed up and slow down as needed for good quality. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are primarily issues with high vertex density versus low vertex density, not variable density. Small pockets of high detail are usually not problematic, as long as they are small enough that the motion planner queue (say, 16 segments) doesn't get filled with too many very small movements. A few small segments in a row is ok, but a few dozen is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are limitations baked into the algorithms used by today's slicers and motion controllers. In the future, they may not be so problematic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-16T15:51:57.763" CommentCount="2" />

For example, G0 X10 will move the X motor 10 units.  The units are set through G20 or G21.  When your machine has lost power, you need to rehome all axis in order for the machine to know where it is.  If you don't, it will likely think that it currently is at 0,0,0,0.  Then when you have the line, G1 F3600 X210.390 Y105.771 E4104.65185 it will try to go from 0,0,0,0 to 210.390, 105.771, 0, 4104.65185 at the feed rate of 3600. Therefore it is always good to home after power loss and add a G92 E4104.4(last line ran before power loss) even if your machine may not need it.

This drastic fluctuation between the build platform (or BuildTak) and the part should make it easier to remove the part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_coefficient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;temperature coefficient&lt;/a&gt; is going to be different between the build plate, BuildTak, and the 3D printed part. So, each part rises and falls in temperature at different rates. When objects are heated and cooled, they expand and contract (respectively). Essentially, as each object expands and contracts at different rates, the objects begin to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good example is if you've ever placed a jar into the fridge/freezer to make it easier to open.

I also have the option of using Raspberry Pi + LabVIEW using LINX (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labviewmakerhub.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.labviewmakerhub.com/&lt;/a&gt;). I looked at nanoDLP (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nanodlp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nanodlp.com/&lt;/a&gt;), which is a control software for DLP based 3D printers. However, I can't figure out how they manage to display the desired images to the DLP. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question 2: Is it possible to display a SVG file to the DLP instead of PNG/JPG/BMP? If not, how do I know which resolution to use when converting SVG to PNG/JPG/BMP? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastEditorUserId="1401" LastEditDate="2016-05-23T17:24:47.377" LastActivityDate="2016-11-26T22:20:55.767" Title="How to display images on DLP using HDMI for 3D printing?"

I had similar effect when I used extensive retraction with low quality filament. In fact filament was to soft and when it was pressed to hobbed pulley/bolt it became flatened and then stopped flowing.

In fact, whether any particular material is approved by regulators (such as the US FDA) for food contact is much more complex than most people realize. Materials can be accepted for some uses and not others. But there are two major considerations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does the material leach into the food, or does the food leach into the material?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can the material be adequately cleaned and sterilized between repeated food exposures?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether leaching is a concern will depend on the kind of contact. For example, nylon will absorb acids but is often used for potable water service. ABS is fine for cold foods but not hot foods. PLA (injection grade) is often used for disposable plastic forks and cold beverage cups, but rarely reusable containers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some anecdotal evidence that lots of 3D printing filaments, particularly cheap Asian filaments, contain toxic chemicals in the pigments and additives. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, strontium, and all sorts of nasty organic chemicals have been found. You probably WON'T get any meaningful leaching of these chemicals in the brief exposure with cookie dough, but to be safe I would only use reputable US and EU filament manufacturers for food contact. I would also stick to filament colors that use non-toxic pigments (eg plain white is almost always safe titanium dioxide) or no pigments at all (&quot;natural&quot; color). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cleaning a cookie cutter for multiple uses, ABS is probably a much better choice than PLA, because ABS can withstand fairly hot water without losing shape. PLA probably won't survive a cycle through the dishwasher. PETG is perhaps a better choice than ABS for longer contact with wet foods, but may or may not survive the dishwasher. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the porous structure of 3D printed parts is a serious problem for cleanliness. The tiny grain structure and voids between extruded strands can act as a safe haven for bacteria between uses. This is particularly an issue with cookie dough containing raw egg. A porous surface for raw-food handling would not be acceptable in a commercial kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the odds of actually transmitting salmonella via poorly-cleaned cookie cutter may be fairly low. Lots of people cut meat at home on wooden cutting boards (which are also porous) and never get sick. Properly cooking the food immediately after handling will go a long way towards reducing the odds of harmful cross-contamination. You'll have to decide for yourself whether the risk profile is worth it. One-time use is the conservative choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-31T18:20:54.407" CommentCount="0" />

The pigments used can affect the melting point somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms may give you a guide as to how to adjust your temperature:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing too hot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small/slow prints may not solidify quickly enough, leaving you with an ugly blob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stringing/bad bridging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic in the heatbreak may soften, leading to clogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might burn/degrade the material (but for this you would really need to go outside of the temperature range).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing too cool:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much force required to extrude, leading so skipping/grinding of the filament drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer delamination: the plastic needs to be hot enough to partially melt the layer below it and stick to it.

Unfortunately, this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation. A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around $1000, and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate. You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded. (Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder.) PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat. PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp. (PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET, but it still happens to a limited degree.) ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most, which is part of why it's favored for injection molding, but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers. &lt;strong&gt;In practice, this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you print a variety of different colors, and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color, it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching. Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool, either. So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output. You're not going to run off a new spool with 95% virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print, are you? Likewise for material matching. Mixing materials is a bad idea. &lt;strong&gt;If you only print white PLA, this is all pretty easy to manage. But if you print a variety of colors and materials, you've got to set up a material tracking, sorting, and storage operation.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it... it's just a hassle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diameter control is difficult. 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality. This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process. Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects. You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle -- &quot;die swell&quot; will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle. Then you have to actually &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter. The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results. Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are just the major issues. Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth. For a home user of 3d printers, making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby. In my opinion, it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s) and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reducing and reusing are preferable to recycling. Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or &quot;downcycle&quot; them for productive uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I personally keep a box of failed prints (and calibration prints and&#xA;no-longer-needed prototypes) as showpieces for people who want to&#xA;learn about 3D printing, and as toys for my nieces and nephews. I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a &quot;toy&quot; calibration model like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Benchy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090268&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CaliBlocks&lt;/a&gt;. 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Failed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims, sacrificial&#xA;cushions when clamping or hammering or drilling, or as scrap for experimenting&#xA;with adhesives or post-processing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment&#xA;layer, or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints. Unfortunately, most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards.

If objects are placed in the center then it's quite obwious that thermistor should be placed also in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue in terms of thermistors are the wires. Because thermistors can be so sensitive then wires should have as less influence as possible on its temperature capacity. That's why wires and thermistor legs are so thin. Generally thiner than regular element's legs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answering your question - I would say it's better to put thermistor in the center hole, to use thermal grease in the hole so thermistor would have contact with HB.

Placing the thermistor at the edge the edge will be at the setpoint while the center will be hotter than the setpoint.

It has been noted that brass nozzles contain trace amounts of lead. This lead can contaminate the printed part, which may in turn contaminate your mold, which may in turn contaminate your food. I don't think this is of realistic concern, since we're looking at trace amounts of trace amounts of lead. The nozzle might also have burnt plastic stuck to it (which might be carcinogenic) so you should make sure to do the print with a very clean nozzle and at a temperature that is not too high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ABS is food safe for contact with cold or room-temperature food. It is however not food safe for contact with hot food, because at higher temperatures the food may leach certain chemicals out of the plastic. Your application is one of low temperature, but silicone is not food and might perhaps leach some contaminants out of the plastic, regardless of temperature. However, this concern is not specific to 3D printing, as it applies to the method of making moulds out of Lego bricks as well.

You can see this in your gcode if you slice files with different layer heights. &lt;em&gt;Before you add special slicer settings and offsets,&lt;/em&gt; if you print 0.1mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.1mm, and if you print 0.3mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.3mm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons this is more complex and less reliable than it seems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different slicers assume different initial tramming gaps.&lt;/strong&gt; And your actual tramming gap may not match that assumption. If the slicer thinks your nozzle is leveled at Z=0 with a real physical gap of 0.1mm to start with, that means gcode Z=0.1mm is actually a 0.2mm gap that must be filled with plastic. So the slicer must compensate by starting lower than the nominal layer height. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what works perfectly for one slicer won't necessarily work correctly for another slicer. And if you tram with a thinner object than the slicer expects (say a post-it note instead of business card) then your first layer will be off.  This is why I personally prefer physical build plate leveling mid-print using screws while watching the strands go down. It bypasses all the assumptions about tramming gaps and just gives you the correct result. (Or you can do the same thing with babystepping in firmware that supports that.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that &lt;strong&gt;people use lots of weird, ad hoc slicer tricks to get their first layer to stick&lt;/strong&gt;. Things like printing the first layer much hotter, or at half speed, or squashed way down and over-extruded, or at 60% layer height, or at 200% extrusion width, will all affect the extrusion volume calibration and the space-filling behavior of the molten plastic flowing onto the bed. The slicer doesn't really have the ability to understand &quot;your&quot; first-layer adhesion recipe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The combination of incorrect/unknown tramming gap and person-specific first-layer settings is why the slicer can't always get the first layer height and extrusion volume correct across all layer heights. Within some fairly reasonable assumptions, the slicer is smart enough to always correctly relate extruder flow and nozzle position so it fills the space between the nozzle and whatever surface you're printing onto. But if you break those assumptions, it may perform differently for different settings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T15:57:41.970" CommentCount="0" />

These could be mitigated by heating the object in an inert atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to answer the question, I would suggest looking at bronze alloys because they melt at moderate temperatures, and are less prone to oxidation than aluminum alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2082" LastActivityDate="2016-06-09T17:52:05.270" CommentCount="0" />

This is necessary to develop the proper &quot;cap zone&quot; semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle. Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing. If using neither filament nor pellets, such as clay printers, the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump. (It is possible to pump molten metal, but the cost is quite high.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material, without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must have some combination of low shrinkage, the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp, and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals tend to have a conflict between &quot;Staying where you put it&quot; and &quot;bonding with the previous layer.&quot; In order for deposited metal to fully bond, the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs. And in order to supply enough heat to remelt the interface without an additional heat source like an arc, the deposited molten metal needs to be very hot. So it will tend to run while it cools. High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every DIY metal 3d print (such as made by wire-feed MIG welders) ends up looking something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTyNd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTyNd.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to &quot;diffusion weld&quot; and adhere WITHOUT fully remelting the interface. Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively. The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains. This will occur between the glass point and melting point, without true fusion occurring. So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden, and still get good bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metals also tend to be very stiff, which encourages warping. It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses, whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is possible to &quot;FDM-style&quot; 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus.&lt;/strong&gt; It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MetalPrinting.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;been done using solder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.reprap.org/2011/06/new-approach-to-printing-metals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;similar alloys&lt;/a&gt;. However, between the warping stresses, poor layer bonding from inadequate interface re-melting, and use of soft low-melting alloys, &lt;strong&gt;the resulting printed parts will usually end up being weaker than if they had simply been printed in a strong plastic.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, PEEK is nearly as strong as aluminum, and carbon fiber or fiberglass composite plastics can exceed metals on various performance metrics. So what's the point of printing with weak, brittle metal alloys?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, lots of people have tried FDM-style metal printing, but no one has found it worthwhile to pursue in the long run.

This is one of the most direct uses of the enclosure, which can be achieved by almost no other means. One could sloppily say it does for the whole print what the heatbed does for the initial layers. Controlling the temperature can be beneficial for layer adhesion and can help against delamination problems. This can go as far as fixing cracks and complete delamination (Thanks to @J.

This happens in at least two ways, - the heated bed will also heat the surroundings, that is the inside of the enclosure.

In that sense, it also&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shuts out any wind for print temperature stability. Also dust and particles that could be blown on the print will be shut out (thanks to the addition of dust/particles: @Obmerk Kronen). This is a benefit that comes without having a heated chamber or filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helps to keep the printer clean in between use.

In regards to the length of your guide tubes, ensure that the tube is relatively straight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are holding the filament above the machine, chances are that you wont really need the tubes anyways and the distance between the spool and the extruder won't matter either.

The tubes can provide many point of contact and managing so many lines at once may become problematic. So, possibly drop the tubes and intend on not drawing your filament unless they are fed into the extruder. You could install smaller ends of tubes at either end of assembly (one at the storage rack, the other above the extruder) to ensure the filament is being fed/pulled straight.

For example, if you do not enclose the top of your machine, then the temperature at the beginning of your print will be potentially different than further into the print.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post-print delamination/warping. The same can be said for a printer without an enclosure. But if you are too eager to remove the print directly after printing, you run the risk of essentially &quot;air quenching&quot; the part. Instead, let the part sit in the warmer ambient temperature and become fully solid again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enclosures are not a &quot;fix-all&quot;. Enclosures are merely a means of reducing variability in your process. As an operator, you should still fine-tune your process by finding the right extruder/HBP temperatures and quality materials to ensure repeatable, quality prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kamuro touched on this a bit, but difficulty performing maintenance. Speaking from experience, removing acrylic panels from a machine not designed to have an enclosure is pretty annoying. However, this could be alleviated with a better design. I chose to bolt my panels to my machine, but a snap design would fair better. Specifically, adjusting my belt tension became very difficult on my Replicator Dual after adding acrylic panels.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't make it too hot. I made a rookie mistake after adding an enclosure to my machine by using a space heater in the room next to the printer. The space heater oscillated and occasionally directed the heat at the machine. After a few failed prints, I noticed that the extra ambient heat in the room was causing the ABS arms for my HBP to warp under the heat/weight of the HBP. The enclosure wasn't the root cause, but it helped trap the extra heat inside the machine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-06-14T17:22:13.360" LastActivityDate="2016-06-14T17:22:13.360" CommentCount="3" />

It does not answer your question, but hopefully may help many people who are reading the question when choosing between the two materials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acrylic is less stable and will probably wear off faster than a well-built MDF frame for a 3D printer! I will address the points separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An MDF frame has much(!) more mass than acrylic, which will reduce vibrations immediately. Almost more important, a box frame, as typical for the Prusa i3 for example, stabilizes itself intrinsically more by its 'redundant wall' design (don't beat me up over the wording here, I didn't find a better way to describe the property that results from the towers.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Compare these two images taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;reprap wiki Prusa i3&lt;/a&gt;:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rDp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rDp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boxframe (from reprap-wiki)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkWVF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkWVF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;metal frame (from reprap-wiki)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;You will probably not find an acrylic frame with this design. Shear stress as produced by the moving carriages, as well as z-wobble from the rods should theoretically be much less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The acrylic might not wear by 'natural causes' since it is not a biologic material as wood is, but it will wear much faster due to handling the material, maintenance and human errors. The material is very brittle. You can find lots of reports on the web where the frame cracked or broke during setup. Here is my favorite example from someone with a lot of experience (1:20-2:30): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkVk8c8XoU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkVk8c8XoU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acrylic is a bad choice in terms of its mechanical properties: It is soft (I found low tensile strength as a number to compare in the given database), has lots of thermal expansion (5 times higher than stainless steel) and melts at 160 C (so beware of anything touching your hotend). Feel free to compare it to other materials here (no MDF or plywood in that database, though ;-) ): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodfellow.com/E/Polymethylmethacrylate.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.goodfellow.com/E/Polymethylmethacrylate.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This altogether makes acrylic a very bad choice for a 3d printer frame material in my opinion.

I only focused on variables you might see out of a hobbyist-style machine and if you've operated any of these you'll know that there are many more variables that pop up for any of these machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, do not expect such a plug-n-play solution as each machine requires quality construction of its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the ability to handle the variability of the process in its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and, above all, an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;operator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that understands the correlation and balance of these components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of that being said, there are some machines that seem to be tailored to this such as the machine by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diyouware.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Diyouware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zmorph3d.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ZMorph&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(No affiliation, just examples)&lt;/sub&gt;. However, notice that they have created their own software to meet a lot of these communication requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I forgot to mention the fact that a kink in creating a interchangeable machine is the control interface. The controller converts the &quot;software speak&quot; into an easily parsed series of functions (typically G-Code) for the small computer to process its predetermined hardware processes. Ie, The slicer or CAM software determines that a layer of a circle be 3D printed, milled, routered, or lasered, so the controller should &lt;strong&gt;G02I2&lt;/strong&gt; which could parse to &lt;sub&gt;(For all intents and purposes in javascript, not a practical language)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;CWCircularInterpolation(2,null,null,null,null,null)&lt;/code&gt; and run as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function CWCircularInterpolation(i,j,k,x,y,z){&#xA; //Some code to take current position and command to create a canned circle path&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that the software needs to handle the conditions and constraints of a different machining process and provide a well-equipped machine with the right commands.

But the equilibrium moisture content of most plastics in humid air can be more like 1%. As a consequence, &lt;strong&gt;hot air dehydration is standard practice&lt;/strong&gt; to prepare plastic pellets for extrusion in industry. Pretty much every injection-molded and extruded plastic product in the world -- including 3d printer filament -- is made with pre-dried pellets. Hot air is blown through the pellets until they are below the moisture limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different plastics tolerate extrusion with different amounts of moisture, and absorb different amounts of moisture. They can also tolerate different drying temperatures. So the ideal storage and drying conditions vary by material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs relatively little moisture, but in humid environments can accumulate enough water content to cause steam bubbles during extrusion. In some cases, steam bubbles can contribute to hot end jamming. Extreme wetness has been known to cause swelling that can increase filament feed drag. It's arguable whether wetness actually causes brittleness, or if that is a separate aging issue. People who keep their homes below ~50% relative humidity usually don't have any problems. Leaving PLA in a dry environment for a week or two should adequately re-dry it, or it can be gently heated to about 120F / 50C for a couple hours. (Some people dry it hotter. but that risks deforming the filament.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABS&lt;/strong&gt; also doesn't absorb very much water, but perhaps a little more than PLA. It also experiences steam bubbles, but that's typically the only issue. Homes below ~45% RH usually don't have problems. Storing ABS with fresh silica gel for a couple weeks will dry it. Or it can be oven-dried up to about 180F / 80C for an couple hours. &lt;strong&gt;HIPS&lt;/strong&gt; can be treated the same. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The kind of PET used in plastic bottles is rapidly degraded into tar by hydrolysis when melted with any significant water content. So &lt;strong&gt;PETG&lt;/strong&gt; filaments are specially blended to absorb less water and to be less damaged by water than PET. But there is still the possibility of bubbles and cloudy strands due to steam expansion at higher temperatures, and there is some evidence that wet PETG produces weaker, more brittle prints than dry PETG. Different manufacturers' blends require different conditions: some people report Taulman t-glase needs oven-drying and careful storage while Esun PETG is fairly tolerant of normal home humidity levels. Oven-drying at 150F / 65C should work well. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nylon&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs a huge amount of water, which causes it to swell considerably, produce massive steam bubbles, look cloudy, warp more, and adhere less than properly-dried nylon. It's nearly unprintable when wet. It should be oven-dried at around 150F / 65C for 4+ hours -- desiccant will not strip enough moisture from it. In fact, nylon will pull water out of used silica gel! Once dry, it should be stored with an aggressive desiccant (either bone-dry silica or preferably calcium chloride). It only takes a few hours of exposure to air for it to become excessively moist. Building a sealed drybox feed system is highly recommended to avoid exposed time during and between prints. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycarbonate&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to nylon in that is is an aggressive water-absorber. It will look cloudy, produce steam bubbles, warp more, and provide very poor layer bonding when wet. It should be oven-dried at 180F / 80C if on a plastic spool (up to 250F / 120C if dried alone) for 4+ hours and then stored in a drybox with aggressive desiccant just like nylon. Note that some modern PC blends like Esun ePC are less prone to water absorption, at the cost of some decrease in mechanical properties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PVA&lt;/strong&gt; is basically destroyed by airborne humidity, since it literally dissolves in water. Store in a drybox with an aggressive desiccant at all times. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composite filaments should be treated like the base material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some drying and prevention options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oven&lt;/strong&gt;: The &quot;warm&quot; setting will usually work pretty well. Let the oven preheat and settle out for a while, and measure temperature with a good oven thermometer or thermocouple. Shield the filament from direct radiant heating and hot spots with aluminum foil, cookie sheets, etc. Electric ovens will dry faster than gas ovens, because burning natural gas produces some additional moisture. Do not leave the oven unattended if using temperatures above the glass point of the filament, or bad things may happen!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Light bucket&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: A 5-gallon plastic bucket with an incandescent lightbulb inside is a pretty effective way to gently warm low-temp filament like PLA for drying or medium-term storage. Leave the lid slightly open if drying. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food dehydrator&lt;/strong&gt;: Works great. Set temperatures as per the oven temps above. The main challenge is getting a large enough space inside for a filament spool. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desiccant&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for desiccant to actively dry filament, it must be significantly more attractive to water than the filament is. And affinity for water is a function of how wet the material already is. That means dry desiccant can easily pull some water out of very wet filament, but wet desiccant can actually give water TO the filament! Rechargeable indicator desiccant (such as an &lt;em&gt;Eva-Dry E-333&lt;/em&gt; unit) is ideal. It's also important to have ENOUGH desiccant: silica gel can only absorb 10% of its weight in water at 20% RH. That means to pull 1% moisture content out of a wet 1kg spool, you would need to start with at least 100g of bone-dry, fresh-baked silica! &quot;Used&quot; silica is basically useless, it already contains too much water to pull any more from the filament. But you can re-dry the silica in an oven. 250F / 120C for 6 hours should be safe for all types of silica gel, but more aggressive drying (including microwave drying) is possible for some silica gels. Follow the gel manufacturer instructions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice&lt;/strong&gt;: Does not work. It's basically a myth that rice has drying power. A bag of rice you buy at the store is already pretty close to moisture equilibrium with the air, so it has minimal capacity to pull water from filament (or a soaked iPhone, for that matter). If you dry the rice in an oven to drive out its water first, it will work to some degree, but silica gel is considerably more effective. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitty litter&lt;/strong&gt;: Silica gel style kitty litter is nearly identical to desiccant silica gel. Like rice, it is fairly close to saturated when you open the container, but can be dried in the oven to be a good cheap bulk desiccant. Clay type kitty litter is not as effective. Be careful of getting kitty litter dust all over your filament. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry storage&lt;/strong&gt; A thick plastic box with an airtight seal is preferable. Look for recycling code 2 (HDPE) or 5 (PP) on the box. 5 gallon buckets with sealing lids also work fine. Ziplocks and other thin plastic bags are better than nothing, but are permeable to water (yes, really) and can only be relied on as long as there is fresh desiccant in the bag. Acrylic/plexiglas dryboxes have been sold by various people, but acrylic is very permeable to water, so I don't recommend that option. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air conditioning&lt;/strong&gt;: Simply keeping the air in your printing environment reasonably dry will protect PLA and ABS and other low-absorption filaments. It may help to buy a humidity monitor to get an understanding of your ambient humidity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, considering the original question here, it's important to note that moisture content is not the only way filament can age or be damaged. PLA in particular is prone to becoming brittle over time. There are different theories for why this occurs. One is gradual chemical aging because poly(lactic acid) simply is not a very stable polymer. Moisture could contribute to that aging process, but true chemical aging would be irreversible even if the filament is later dried. How much this occurs should depend on the specific polymer blend and storage conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory for PLA aging is that the residual filament extrusion stresses (from being drawn down to the correct diameter and rapidly quenched in a water bath) are slowly creeping over time. Anyone who has placed a PLA part under heavy load for more than a few weeks will see PLA creep. It's a rather odd polymer in that it will &quot;creep to failure&quot; and crack at very low creep elongations rather than progressively deform in a ductile manner like most creep-prone materials. So if the PLA has significant stresses locked-in from the initial extrusion process (which is very common) it may be creeping into a more brittle arrangement of polymer molecules over time. That would explain the aging effect, and it would explain why &quot;drying&quot; sometimes rejuvenates the PLA: heating the filament near its glass point will allow the polymer molecules to gently relax and basically anneal to a less brittle state. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-06-22T16:39:59.473" LastActivityDate="2016-06-22T16:39:59.473" CommentCount="2" />

Basically, the speed at which you feed filament determines how large of a volume comes out, and the distance you move the extruder means this volume gets distributed over this distance. However, this is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The size of your nozzle determines only two things: the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; layer height and the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; feature size. It does not affect minimum layer height (and obviously doesn't affect maximum feature size) although there are some practical constraints (you wouldn't want to print 0.1mm layers with a 5mm nozzle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nozzle squishes the filament down as it is extruded; the filament is basically forced into the gap between the nozzle and the previous layer. There's no limit to how thin of a layer you can print (the 60 micron figure is just something the marketing department made up, you can likely print even thinner layers). So long as you can position your Z-axis with sufficient accuracy (which is usually no problem) you can print arbitrarily thin layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the nozzle size does determine the maximum layer height. Your need the filament to be squished a bit, or else it won't stick to the previous layer properly. You can't print layers thicker than your nozzle size, and it is generally recommended to print with a layer size that is at most 80% of your nozzle size (e.g. with a 0.4mm nozzle you shouldn't attempt to print layers thicker than 0.32mm) but this is just a guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your extrusion width is the width of the line deposited by your nozzle. This is generally (due to the mentioned squishing) a bit larger than your nozzle size. With a 0.4mm nozzle you should set your extrusion width to something slightly larger, like 0.5mm. It is technically possible to print with an extrusion width that is the same as (or even smaller) than your nozzle size, but this results in very weak prints: as mentioned before, you want the plastic to get squished slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They claim an accuracy up to 100 micron. This doesn't mean that you can print features as small as 100 micron (since you can't, due to the extrusion width being much larger). What this means, is for example, that if you print a 10mm cube, you should expect its real size to be between 9.9mm and 10.1mm. Such a cube does not have any features that are smaller than your minimum feature size, but its outer walls can be positioned with greater precision than this minimum feature size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should caution you that the 100 micron figure is &quot;up to&quot; and in practice you will have a hard time achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="5656" LastEditDate="2017-01-16T23:49:17.253" LastActivityDate="2017-01-16T23:49:17.253" CommentCount="1" />

There are a number of fixes occurring in the dev branch right now (June 2016) if you look at Github. So it's getting better, but I wouldn't call it mature yet. (Delta auto-calibration is one of the only big shortcomings of Repetier, in my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with approaches like bed plane compensation and grid/mesh leveling for Deltas is that they don't fix print geometry errors caused by imprecise printer construction. They just help get the first layer down. What I would recommend is to use one of the non-Repetier delta auto-calibration techniques available in order to get your firmware settings correct, and then you won't need to use &quot;slap a bandaid on a calibration problem&quot; solutions like grid leveling. Two popular options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Rich Cattell's Marlin branch&lt;/strong&gt;, perform auto-calibration, record the adjusted values, and then load those parameters into Repetier. This will usually work well enough that you don't need to attempt any kind of auto-leveling in Repetier. (I don't recommend actually printing with Marlin on a Delta due to lack of performance optimization. Repetier can print much, much faster while managing more features like LCDs. Marlin gets bogged down doing all the Delta kinematics math unless you print very slow.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use David Crocker's awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://escher3d.com/pages/wizards/wizarddelta.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online delta calibration tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I'd recommend using six-factor calibration with 10 probe points. This is the manual version of the auto-calibration technique built into dc42 RepRapFirmware, and it's practically magical compared to the routines built into Repetier. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: Grid leveling can be a very useful technique for large printers where bed flatness is difficult to achieve.

Preparing your model for this is called &quot;slicing&quot;, since you are &quot;slicing&quot; your model into these layers.

Each layer therefore produces a little bit of force, pulling upwards and towards the center of the layer as the layer shrinks.  So each layer is actually in a state of slightly tensile stress.&#xA;Over a few layers this may not cause a noticeable effect, but as more layers are added, the total force pulling on the bottom layer increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason this affects corners more than the bulk surface regions is that the total surface area holding the part to the bed is smaller at sharper corners, so less force is required there to overcome the bed-adhesion force, causing corners to unstick eventually.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this is an artifact of thermal expansion, attempting to maintain a uniform temperature across the print volume/printed part will probably help a lot (for example, by enclosing the printer, as others have said).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prior suggestions, the following paper suggests that chamfering (rounding) the corners can help with this (if your design allows for that):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;amp;context=ijaaa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;D.

Sharp corners at the bottom of the print pose a particular problem.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side-thought:&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;I wonder if varying the bed temperature during the print (for example, slowly decreasing it to room-temp as more layers are printed) would help, since a constant bed-temp would theoretically produce a vertical temp-gradient for a very tall part.  Don't think I've seen anyone try that (presumably because Cura doesn't automatically insert those g-code commands for us).

However, there are no rules that say you can't change the color of the object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this application, &lt;strong&gt;I would suggest just going ahead and spray painting the object and scanning it&lt;/strong&gt;. Scanning the insole is going to require super tight tolerances in scanning as I'm assuming the insole is naturally worn due to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Completely alternatively from 3D scanning, you could try using a 3D touch probe like on a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). It will take longer, but a touch probe doesn't care what color the object is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The touch probe comment seems to be a hit, so I'll elaborate. My experience with touch probes comes only from manufacturing technology and can be found and in a variety of different machine tools:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lathes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CMMs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vision Systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Romer&quot; Arms (aka portable CMM)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could probably get away with searching for a local machine shop (or job shop) and asking if they have a machine for reverse engineering. The quickest and easiest machine for reverse engineering (in my experience) is a portable CMM, I recommend Googling it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I've heard of people adding touch probes to their 3D Printers, but I haven't seen it before. In theory, a basic touch probe can easily be achieved by using a momentary switch. If you're good with programming and maybe a bit of Arduino, you could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add momentary (normally off) switch to Arduino &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find a way of attaching the switch (below nozzles)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect to your 3d printer in your preferred method and preferred programming language. I've used the provided libraries in Python that come with installing MakerWare in order to connect to my MakerBot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write your routine to sequentially move the new probe in a grid pattern and then incrementally move the Z up until you get a signal from your Arduino that the momentary has been switched on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For each trigger, append a simple text file with a new line containing the coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once complete, you should have a &quot;point cloud&quot; of your insole which, if formatted correctly, will be able to import into CAD software&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few file types off the top of my head that can be used including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.pts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.XYZ&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.CSV&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-07-05T13:09:06.560" LastActivityDate="2016-07-05T13:09:06.560" CommentCount="2" />

To simplify things we assume that all our pipes are closed into circuit and we have pump/battery and we have a motor which is a reverted pump ;) and finally we have our stepstick which is a tap in our model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no matter what the height (voltage) is we know that tap (stepstick) will pass some amount (current) of water. We can drive it turning tap or turning a potentiometer on the stepstick PCB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we got it. Principles (deadly simplified) are now clear. &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/voltage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;See here for more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to your question. &#xA;You have to know what is your stepstick reference voltage. To make sure about that you have to check out resistor(s) next to main black element on stepstick board. There should be R100 or R200 which are very common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you should read data from motor label to know what is proper current for your motor and calculate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;voltage = motor_current * 8 * resistance_of_resistor&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now you know what is proper voltage for your motor and stepstick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You measure voltage between potentiometer and GND (see on the picture)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LnbU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LnbU.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you set and connect everything and start printouts you should check motor temperature. Use your finger. If you can touch motor and hold your finger not more than half a second then probably the voltage set on potentiometer is too high (motor can reach 80° Celsius and it's fine but more will shorten its life span) and you should reduce it a bit (reduce by 5/100 V). If you notice that motor growls or barks then your voltage is probably too low and you can increase it by 5/100V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Too high current will also reduce longevity of stepstick so cool them out with fan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be noticed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Z-axis motors will usually be not too hot as they work less than X and Y but as they are both connected to one stepstick so they need more current - set higher voltage there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Stepstick&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;reprap.org site&lt;/a&gt; to get basic knowledge about stepsticks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1211" LastEditorUserId="854" LastEditDate="2016-08-01T22:45:16.660" LastActivityDate="2016-08-01T22:45:16.660" CommentCount="2" />

Most information you need is in there, I want to give some more practical advice, since that is what I understand you're question is asking for. I'll start with some points on the more theoretical side, though:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;notice that the Vref is not a voltage that is passed on to your motor. The described pipe analogy is very good, but the Vref is outside of this analogy. The reference voltage Vref is only used to set the current limit. This seems confusing, but has electronic reasons. One can understand the major (side-)benefit easily: Voltages are very easy to measure externally, because you connect your voltmeter in parallel. If you wouldd want to measure the current, you would need to get your ammeter in series with the circuit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stepsticks work by supplying the needed current for movement of the motor (current, because it works by creating magnetic fields), the voltage the stepstick supplies is 'just' supplied as high as needed to feed the desired current through your motor (determined by its resistivity/impedance). This just as an add-on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to the practical side and the application of darthpixel's answer and the above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You want to measure the reference voltage to limit the current that produces the torque, but also heats up the motor - let darthpixel's advice be your guide: if you can't touch it because it is too hot, then there is too much current, i.e. Vref is too high). To do so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set your multimeter to volts, range can be autorange or something bigger than 2V.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect one lead of your multimeter to the ground of your Prusa i3 controller board's power input (I use the screw that fastens the ground input of the RAMPS). The other lead goes directly to the center of the trimpot on the Stepstick. I took the best of my paint skills to create an image showing the process: &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cCzl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cCzl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;measure Vref scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Note the value you read (12V power has to be on)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use an insulated screwdriver and turn the trimpot slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a new reading by repeating the measurement process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the whole process until you get the desired Vref.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warning: While I've had no problems turning the trimpot while everything was switched on (with my DRV8825 drivers), you should switch the power supply off when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The described process allows only for a stepwise and rather slow setting of the Vref, but this is the easiest way I've found. I have read of people that use a crocodile clamp to attach the multimeter to the screwdriver for a readout while turning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have any idea whether you need more or less current on the motor at the moment, check your resistors on the board and calculate the Vref you should need (see darthpixel's answer for the formula). I would however just do what darthpixel already suggested: figure out the trimpot position by ears and touch: klicking motor: go to higher Vref. Can't touch the motor for more than some seconds: go to lower Vref. It might be a lengthy process, but in the end you'd need to do it anyway to get the best out of the printer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="168" LastEditorUserId="168" LastEditDate="2016-08-02T09:23:35.373" LastActivityDate="2016-08-02T09:23:35.373" CommentCount="3" />

That's all. Correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like very common situation where some parts are hanging like your yellow disks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise if your model is going to be closed at the bottom and at the top you can mock support on your own to have better control of it. How? Just add hollow cylinders under your disk so in fact cylinder will stay on the bottom layer then its walls will be support and finally your yellow disk will be a top cover of the cylinder. I hopw you can imagine that properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way is to design support elements wich would grow out of walls and this way support your disks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9Z7F.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9Z7F.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you would explain a bit more, what the model is then I could support you more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[edit]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make it more automatic, you could try to use parametric CAD apps. I would say, Autodesk Inventor is one which I can suggest. You can use for example its Ribs functionality as support (varsion C).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[edit2]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After Tormod Haugene's and tbm0115's comments I decided to fill some gaps in my answer. Here go pros and cons of options A, B and C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simplest one and more or less automatic one. Which means when user add support then this option will be a result of it. Of course if user needs to have support only for the disk but over the disk there will be... a &quot;ceiling&quot; then option A cannot use regular support as it will generate a support also for the ceiling. For such situation user needs to add a cylinder manually (filled one) or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;User can add hollow cyliner (just its walls). This option can give similar or higher stiffness as regular support because solid walls increase endurance tahn thin support grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This option (my personal choose) has some advantages unavailable in A or B option. First - support doesn't have to have &quot;ground&quot; base. It means the yellow disk can really hang even if there is no bottom layer at all. Second - it joins walls with disk and walls together so the stiffness concerns other surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on needs the cylinder (option A or B) can be transformed into a cross or pillar (thinner than cylinder itself). It can be more taper expandint to the top or to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There could be even option where the above one would be joined with option C.

I've found that the heated bed temperature values on the LCD are incorrect.  The heater works, and the controller maintains the bed temp just fine, but the temperature reported isn't the true temperature.  When using the PLA preset, with the bed set for 60°C, once the temperature stabilizes at 60°C on the display, I can measure it with a laser thermometer and get a consistent 54°C across the buildplate.  With the ABS preset of 90°C, I read 80°C.  And with the bed set for the maximum value of 120°C, I'm only reading 102-104°C.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've checked these values with the bare aluminum build plate, and I've allowed the temps to stabilize for at least 10 minutes to ensure that I have consistent readings.  I believe the the firmware is using the wrong temperature curve for the thermistor in my device.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that there was a simple scaling constant that I could adjust, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I've tried to follow this line of research but I feel like I'm going around in circles.  It sounds like I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; build a custom version of the firmware to install on my printer, and in doing so I could potentially specify a better conversion table.  This gives me pause for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I haven't found any online reference to other people installing a custom Repetier build on a Wanhao I3.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea what values to use for the temp conversion table.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I can't even find anyone else reporting my issue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm fairly new to this; I rather not brick my printer, and I haven't found any good guides to installing firmware on the device either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm not convinced this is the right option.

The following is a list of components which you might find in a typical hotend, but note that different designs may integrate these components to some extent. For instance, on the J-head the heat block, nozzle and heatbreak are all one and the same component whereas on the E3D hotends these are all separate parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nozzle&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the part where the filament comes out. It takes in the molten filament (typically as a bead of 1.75mm/3mm) and tapers down to the nozzle size (typically around 0.4mm). These are typically made of brass for its good heat conductivity, but brass is not suitable for printing abrasive materials (such as glow in the dark and metal-filled filaments) so sometimes (hardened) stainless steel is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Block&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually made from aluminium, the heater block joins the nozzle to the heat break and holds the heater cartridge and thermistor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: most hotends use a ceramic heater cartridge, though some older designs use power resistors or nichrome wire. This component is, as the name suggests, responsible for heating up the hotend. The heat block usually clamps around the heater cartridge to provide good contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermistor&lt;/strong&gt;: This part senses the temperature of the heat block. It is usually a small glass bead with two wires attached (which are typically insulated with glass fiber or teflon). For high-temperature printing, a thermocouple may be used in stead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Break&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the part where hot meets cold. It usually takes the form of a thin tube and is made of stainless steel for its low thermal conductivity. The goal is generally to have the transition be as short as possible so as little of the filament is in a molten state as possible. It connects the heat block to the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Sink&lt;/strong&gt;: the purpose of the heat sink is to cool down the cold side of the heat break. It is typically cooled with a fan. Most heat sinks also have a standard groove-mount for mounting to your printer. The heat sink usually has grooves to increase its surface area and cooling capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teflon Liner&lt;/strong&gt;: some hotends have a PTFE liner that guides the filament through the heat break into the nozzle. This makes it easier to print PLA, but compared to an all-metal hotend, limits the temperatures at which you can print (making it difficult to print PETG and impossible to print polycarbonate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ubis hotend you mentioned is a bit simpler than this, and simply uses a big chunk of PEEK in place of the heat break/sink. PEEK has very low thermal conductivity and thus passive cooling is sufficient. However, PEEK limits the temperatures at which you can print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an illustration outlining these components on an E3D V6 hotend:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in this image the Teflon liner only goes into the heat sink, and not into the heat break or block.

Increasing &lt;strong&gt;Minimum Layer Duration&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(Device Settings -&gt; Minimum Layer Duration)&lt;/sub&gt; will provide the material with more time to naturally cool down closer to its environment's temperature. What this does is ensure that the latest layer is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; solid before the machine begins printing the next molten layer. If you don't let the previous layer of plastic solidify enough, then plastic gets pushed/pulled around when the machine moves, adding more plastic; thus resulting in the issue you see in your images. The caveat with this approach is the obvious impact on the overall runtime of your print and should ideally be done more or less as a last resort.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/strong&gt;. Active cooling is typically done using an additional fan, often times mounted directly in front of the extruder. The act of active cooling provides a quicker and more direct means of cooling the printed plastic. However, depending on machine design, you may see more variability on other places such as dependability in extrusion temperatures. This can be more detrimental with cheaper spools of PLA and especially poorly designed machines that can't properly maintain extruder temperatures. Active cooling is, however, very common and seems to work for the majority of 3D printer enthusiasts and doesn't impede on runtime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-07-20T22:21:44.703" LastActivityDate="2016-07-20T22:21:44.703" CommentCount="0" />

The review also cites detailed procedures to 3D print lung and skin tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to your question, we have reached a point in time where we can scan a real Iris and print them! Yes. And people use this technique called self assembly to achieve this (Other design approaches like Biomimicry and MiniTissue assembly is also being used right now). To do this we first extract cells from the donor. Or We do a functional high res scan of the extracted cell/part that we want to replicate. This is done via FMT-CT-Fluorescence Imaging, etc. And we cultivate the cells in bio incubators (we can also print cells btw - If the exact environment and operational conditions are maintained, we can print cell-replicas that will later self assemble to form the Iris with the same resolution and functional properties as that of the real one). The cultivated/printed cell is used as the tissue forming material. Forming is done by the cells themselves and is thus christened Self assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this may sound futuristic, Autonomous Self Assembly is something that's already being done in Labs! The method works by studying embryonic organ development. For instance, Early stage cellular components of a developing tissue makes their own ECM. Like mentioned before, if we use proper signalling, and environmental manipulation,  we can create autonomous organization and patterning to make something we want. Advantage of this method is that we can work without scaffolds. This method relies on cell as primary driver of histogenesis. Knowledge of how an embryo grows into tissue (embroyo tissue genesis and organogenesis) is applied to achieve &quot;real&quot; cell dimensions/properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you to read the paper for detailed information.

Hobbyists use it as a build plate -- Stratasys uses it as filament in their most expensive FDM machines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Polycarbonate is a specialty material that benefits from a heated chamber but is just barely printable on hobbyist level machines. (I print a fair amount of PC -- it makes ABS seem easy in comparison.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By alloying PC with PEI, they are presumably optimizing some kind of performance parameter compared to ultem alone or polycarbonate alone. Exactly what material properties they get will depend considerably on the ratio of the two polymers. Ultem is exceptionally heat-resistant, quite stiff, and extremely strong. PC is very heat resistant, and has exceptional impact toughness. Blends of the two can be somewhat stiffer than either, with most other properties resembling the weighted average of the two base materials. It really depends on the mix, which we don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is analogous to the PC-ABS blend filaments we sometimes use. You get reasonably intermediate properties. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it's basically super-filament that NASA might want to use to make &quot;production&quot; parts in space.

This is reasoned by the shrinkage of the builplate while the print stays extended. The strain put into the interface helps to get the print of. Warming the plate could essentially do the same, but since you deposit a warm filament, one would assume that by warming up you will reduce the strain that has been built up by the regular cooling of the filament already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess an uneven heating with a hairdryer will probably introduce uneven strain or evan some kind of warping of the buildplate that puts more strain to the interface which makes your approach work. If you want to test whether you have some local deformation you could characterize this by reflecting a laserpointer from the heatbed and marking the reflection on a rather far away wall for some controlled positions you can get the laser in (by say putting it on a photography tripod). The change of this reflections towards each other could tell you about the deformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree that most of the hairdryers around would not be hot enough to be a worry, but since most of the Micro3D is made from plastic I would put twice the time into figuring out if that is really true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just for the fun of it, you could put an ice cube next to your finished print if you make sure that molten water will not go anywhere it is not supposed to be.

These are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;color coded&lt;/a&gt; depending on your country, usually earth is green (possibly with yellow stripes), neutral is blue, black, grey or white and live is brown, red or black.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SSR should have 4 terminals: 2 terminals for the switched load (which are interchangeable) and 2 terminals that connect to your electronics, which should be marked negative and positive. These terminals should connect to the negative/positive heated bed output of your electronics. The terminals of the SSR should be clearly marked, and you can verify which terminal is what from the SSR's datasheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically, your heated bed will have two wires for power (which are interchangeable). One of the wires should be connected to neutral. The other wire should go to one of the load terminals of the SSR, while the other load terminal of the SSR should connect to the live wire. It is also acceptable to do it the other way around (neutral to the SSR and live directly to the bed) but this is slightly less neat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this step is &lt;em&gt;extremely important&lt;/em&gt;, the earth wire of the plug has a protective function: should something fail, metal parts of your printer may become electrified, and shock you when you touch them. To prevent it, you should electrically connect exposed metal parts of your printer (such as the frame, heated bed plate, power supply case, etc...) to earth. This provides a path for the current to flow (and trip the protective RCD breaker) should something go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would further recommend that you protect your heated bed (particularly if it is a high power model) with a bimetallic thermal switch. These are available in a variety of ratings, and will switch the power to your heated bed off when it goes over a certain temperature. This switch should be wired between the relay and the heated bed, and be mounted on the heated bed so it makes good thermal contact. If you plan to print with the heated bed at 110C, you might get a 120C or 130C thermal switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mains voltage can be deadly, you should take appropriate precautions: &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; work on the printer while it is plugged in, cover any connections (in particular, make sure you buy or print a cover for the SSR's terminals and wrap solder joints in heat shrink or electrical tape) and always treat wires coming out of the SSR as live (even if it is switched off, some current can still flow).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2016-08-05T06:05:27.560" CommentCount="0" />

There is a reason that most people cannot break the .1mm barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have several things happening. First if you are using a bowden. Good luck. The bowden treats plastic a lot like a spring. Just wont be able to generate a consistent pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The direct gear will have the same issue. You are trying to spit out 0.1mm on a 0.5mm nozzle. Factor in some simple drooling and your dot of plastic is missing. You wouldn't think it matters, but when we are using such tiny amounts of plastic, and consistently throughout the print, it makes for a really bad result!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you have more issues. This is why you jam. You now have a lot of plastic sitting, not being expelled. When you go from 0.2mm to 0.1mm you now take twice the time. Considering the printer was made to print at a 0.7 to 0.2 range (more or less). We are talking about a fair time for this plastic to sit molten, waiting to come out. Some have mentioned the heat crawl, but not exactly what happens or a solution. Now you do a retraction, and you just retracted molten plastic. Which gets jammed. Or your plastic cooks, carbonizes faster and clogs your hotend. Sad times! What you can do is ... turn off retraction, and then increase your flow / extrusion multiplier to account for the extra drooling. Part will have a lot of stringing, but a quick burst from a lighter fixes most of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get better results with a hotend that has a fan and heat sink / break. I like the e3d hot ends. That will stop the heat crawl. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will note that Makergear once sent me an experimental 0.1mm nozzle. It could not build enough pressure to expel the plastic. I got one tiny bunny, half melted before it clogged from aforementioned carbonization. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like to me you really just need a form 1, or you are a tinkerer like me.

With my previous version of Marlin, 1.0.2-1, everything was working perfectly. I've transferred every parameter over from my older version to my newer one. There were some aspects of code that were written differently, but essentially everything works except the Z-Axis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one issue that I seem to be having is with any kind of movement with the Z-Axis. When it moves, whether from the LCD or Repetier, it appears to accelerate as it is supposed to, but then gets stuck/skips a bunch of steps, and then decelerates slowly as it's supposed to. Regardless of the distance I instruct it to move, it will accelerate normally for the same amount of time/distance/steps, go into this unholy mode for a period of time/distance/steps relative to what it was instructed, and then smoothly decelerates for the exact same amount of time every time. For example, if it is supposed to move 10000 steps, it will move 100 steps smoothly, then skip for 9800 steps, and finish with another 100 steps smoothly. If, for example, it needs to move 5000 steps, it will also move 100 steps smoothly, then skip for 4800 steps, and finish smoothly the last 100 steps. Keep in mind, these numbers are completely drawn from space; they are not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just trying to paint as clear of a picture as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first I checked to make sure everything is mechanically sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nuts move freely up and down the 5mm threaded rod. There are no points along the entire length of the rod that the nuts don't move very freely.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stainless steel rods are well aligned and the entire Z/X-Axis carriage moves very freely along the vertical rails. The bearings appear to be fine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then wanted to narrow it down to being the firmware, and not electrical. For the record, maybe I'm missing something obvious, so please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I measured the voltage on my A4988 stepper drivers on the RAMPS 1.4 board, sitting on the Arduino Mega2560 R3, and it is reading 350mV. Even if I adjust the potentiometer to 550mV, I still get the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The jumpers underneath seem to be snugly in place, and all the pins on the A4988 appear to be fine as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I haven't checked in the section, logically analyzing, is the wires going from the board to the motors themselves, but based on the following, I don't believe that is the issue.

Most materials are stickier when hot than cold. In comparison, pure mechanical-bonding bed surfaces like fibrous painter's tape and perfboard don't particularly benefit from bed heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warping is a bit more complicated. The basic cause of warping is when the previous layer is allowed to cool and thermally contract before the next layer is deposited. When you stick hot, expanded material on top of cold, contracted material, large shear stresses are generated when the fresh material cools and contracts. Those inter-layer shear stresses then accumulate over many layers into large-scale bending stresses that try to lift the edges of the print off the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to prevent warping, we should minimize the amount that the previous layer is allowed to cool before the next layer goes down. But we DO need it to cool solid so the print doesn't sag in a mushy mess. This is a balancing act: cooling the plastic solid without over-cooling it. The optimal temperature for the print is right around the glass point of the plastic: this is the temperature at which the plastic becomes fully solid and thermal contraction stresses start to accumulate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extruder pumps more heat into the print as it deposits molten plastic and radiates a little bit of heat. So we want to set the heatbed temp a little bit below the glass point to ensure the print is able to cool solid. Now, this gets a bit difficult, because everyone's print bed temperature sensor is different. What matters is bed surface temp. Many people have to set their bed temp quite a bit higher than the actual surface temp. It's just something you have to calibrate via print results. The exact filament glass point (Tg) also depends on the blend. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Tg is around 105C, optimal bed temp 95C in a warm, low-airflow environment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Tg is around 55C, optimal bed temp is 55C in a cool, high-airflow environment because PLA holds heat and is slow to cool compared to other filaments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PETG: Tg is around 70C, optimal bed temp is 60-70C with mild airflow&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nylon doesn't really work with these rules because it's semi-crystalline, meaning it &quot;freezes&quot; far above its Tg and thus starts accumulating warping stress at fairly high temps... advice varies wildly, from printing cold to 120C bed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PC: Tg is around 150C, optimal bed temp is 130C&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other schools of thought, for example printing the first layer onto a surface much hotter than Tg for good adhesion, and then dropping the bed temp to a value somewhat below Tg to allow the print to solidify. That works fine too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, with all that said, it's important to understand that the heatbed only keeps the bottom of the print warm. A centimeter up from the build plate, the print is typically much closer to ambient temp than it is to the bed temp. Heated build chambers are thus much more effective for large prints. But heatbeds are still quite effective, because they allow building a strong, warp-free foundation that resists warping stresses induced by the cooler zones higher up in the print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-08-12T21:08:23.000" CommentCount="3" />

RST is normally pulled high with a pull-up resistor (on the order of 10k or so), and when RTS transitions to low the capacitor briefly allows some current to flow, pulling RST low. One way to prevent this is to include a stronger pull-up resistor that overcomes the current drain associated with the RTS line going LOW. &lt;a href=&quot;http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection&lt;/a&gt; suggests using a 330 Ohm resistor between VCC and GND.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hardware: desolder the capacitor mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2016-08-20T22:07:06.097" CommentCount="3" />

Then, it repeats the process for the next layer. If you try to build, for example, a hollow ball, the ball gets created in the middle of the powder, meaning that there will be powder around the outside of the ball and in the &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the ball, and with the ball completely enclosed, there is no way for the powder that ends up inside the ball to get out.

And for my Rostock allowing two to four color switching with a single head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many months I have pondered taking their unit  for its software ability to pre-switch colors and feed it with a three color head. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My plan that I have been mulling for months now is cross mixing of their color switcher with five into one extruder with not a print nozzle but a 1.75 or 3mm filament production nozzle to produce a software timed output based on desired print color effect.  Then feeding that to your single nozzle printer would make a true multi-color mixer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I was thinking on assembling myself this and put it out there for use, but first I hate doing a lot of programing, second I have health issues slowing me down, third is way to many project.  So here is a concept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Five extruders,  CYM-BW cyan, yellow, magenta, black, white&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These feed a forming nozzle 1.75mm out into a pfte tube going to printer extruder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The forming nozzle is several centimeters long and has it own secondary heater.  The interior is milled with a 5 in to a swirl wall (like a mixing nozzle on epoxy).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Color filament feeding three of the nozzles are your primary colors set in the center of the color range.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PrintCOLOR(C, Y, M) command set basically like other color sets 0-255 range.  Difference being is 0 is white filament, 254 is black filament, 255 is no filament, 127 is pure color.  With 1-126 gradient mix of white and color, 128-253 gradient mix of black and color.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Feed by extruders into mixer must total extruder speed of printer, which is where need for PrintCOLOR(C, Y, M) programming is required.  For instance making green out of C and Y.  PrintCOLOR(127, 127, 0) would need half speed blue and half speed yellow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So who knows maybe some one like the makers of Palette or some crowd funder can run with this.&#xA;I think it is fully do able.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three color diamond head can not produce WHITE by mixing. To print white requires dropping one color to substituting in the white. And it requires major modification to many printers to add. The CYM filament picked for use on a diamond head alone sets the maximum darkness allowed.

The fan used to run just fine (for the past 3 months in fact--since purchase). I cannot be certain, but this may be related to the cord getting snagged by the hot-end last week (cables have begun to sag over time). Nothing melted or damaged except for the hard-plastic coil used to bundle all cables together, and that appears to just be minor, cosmetic damage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have checked Cura settings, ensuring that fan operation is selected (starting at 0.6 mm) and that it is being told to run at 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also sent 'M106 S255' from Proterface UI (this, from what I have researched, should turn the fan on at 100%).

I tested the current on another 12V fan laying around and that fan runs just fine. So, it seems that the fan has gone bad...somehow. I am still quite confused on how this would happen.

Repeat until it releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used the Fleks3D print plate on my Flux Delta printer in the past, and it releases &quot;like magic&quot; but I don't think they make monster sheets of your printer size. I had also purchased a pair of 20&quot; square Fleks3D plates for a similarly sized printer that never materialized. I'd be happy to sell you the pair, but I think they are too small for your full plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been said that one can use sand-blasted acrylic, which I believe is the construction of the aforementioned Fleks3D plates. If you have access to 1/8&quot; or 3mm acrylic and can apply a uniform blast of abrasive, you may be able to construct your own easy-release build plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is practical to consider to use a raft for your large builds. Rafts are useful for small items, to provide a greater bonding surface and avoid release, but it also provides a &quot;wedging&quot; location for your release tool. You can more easily slice away the middle of the raft and deal with a thinner layer after the model is completely freed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT ADD: If the bed is not removable, one can build a dam around the model with clay to hold the water for dissolving the glue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="854" LastEditorUserId="854" LastEditDate="2016-09-01T09:37:48.827" LastActivityDate="2016-09-01T09:37:48.827" CommentCount="0" />
  <row Id="2717" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2016-09-01T01:44:51.297" Score="3" ViewCount="193" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am running a Stratasys Dimension 768 SST, with a &quot;rebuilt&quot; extruder (dual setup includes support + model). This extruder, basically, follows the OEM design with exception to the tubing diameter (few mils smaller for rebuilt, although there is a generous inlet taper and/or bushing, larger than the filament diameter feed stock) and the way the tubing has thermal contact with extruder body and cartridge heaters. The OEM design, apparently, had some thermal epoxy to &quot;bed&quot; the 2 nozzle tubes, which are brazed into the nozzle tip block. The approach, I am using, is Al foil packing around the SS tubes, tight to the Al extruder body (still brazed connection to the nozzle tip block). I had no choice but to recondition the extruder, because of a breached nozzle tube. In any case, with a cleared out nozzle inlet to start each time, I do get transient extrusion at standard temperatures of 250 (support) and 280 (model ABS), and in an adjusted temperature range, with some preliminary experiments. I clear out the nozzle inlet with a metal pin, down to the tube bend (I don't get why the design had this problematic 90 deg bend radius close to the cold end, feed wheel!) For the support, the extrusion goes for about 5 secs, then slows down, and the support filament feed stock stalls and strips out the filament, turning it into white debris.  For the model, the extrusion goes longer for about 20 secs, and also slows down, and, in this case, the model feed stock splits and gets fed outside the nozzle tube inlet, but no white debris in this case. This cycle may be repeated by cleaning out the inlet clogging with the stiff metal pin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this is not a perfect description of the system, but I am hoping that someone who knows this extruder configuration or a similar one (system is quite old, unfortunately), may chime in here with suggestions. I will add, that I am running the system in a so-called maintenance mode and have some minimal adjustment of the firmware (like the hot end temperatures - defaults mentioned before) for the build mode (which is only during actual part run).    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for your help or suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some diagrams/link to descriptions for the extruder as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My exact extruder (i.e., head) system:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amtekcompany.com/pdf/dimension_bst_sst_elite_768_head_clog_guide.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.amtekcompany.com/pdf/dimension_bst_sst_elite_768_head_clog_guide.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar extruder (showing heaters, extruder body to isolate model &amp;amp; support paths, tips, and thermocouples)&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwifyLnJsu7OAhVIOCYKHaSIDLQQjRwIBw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.3dprintforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D2237&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNGM1BTAiWzUn4fNJ8-z5HDWxa6OEQ&amp;amp;ust=1472824417165187&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwifyLnJsu7OAhVIOCYKHaSIDLQQjRwIBw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.3dprintforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D2237&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNGM1BTAiWzUn4fNJ8-z5HDWxa6OEQ&amp;amp;ust=1472824417165187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site shows another user take apart/redesign the extruder in question (pay attention to the 90 deg bend in the nozzle tubes)&#xA;(see attached picture)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have a few documents: user manual, service manual, etc. that I may share, if I knew how to upload to this website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4063" LastEditorUserId="4063" LastEditDate="2016-09-01T14:57:09.690" LastActivityDate="2016-10-23T15:16:22.440" Title="Loss of extrusion in Stratasys FDM liquefier" Tags="&lt;extruder&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="1" />

The lowest cost industrial extrusion processes do not use pellets at all- because pellets have already gone through an extrusion process so they are more expensive than powder resin. There is typically a 'compounding' stage where colors etc. are added before extrusion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Significant heat is generated by the screw (which often has a complex geometry) via shear action that is itself temperature and pressure sensitive, and the heat is added to by external heaters in various zones (or subtracted by water cooling and chillers in larger extruders). In some cases we were able to operate an extruder adiabatically- the heat created by the screw motor matched the heat loss as the product left the die and no heating or cooling was needed once the process was stabilized. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The end result is that you want to plasticize (melt) the plastic and achieve a certain pressure at the die. The plastic is deteriorating the higher the temperature and the longer the time so you want to limit the residence time at high temperature. There is some trial-and-error and a lot of previous experience in the setup person's task. Once the parameters are determined they are recorded and are used the next time that material is run.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The size of an extrusion is typically determined exactly by downstream equipment rather than controlling the conditions at the die. It is essentially stretched as it comes out of the die and the heat is removed in a cooling trough. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see a factory environment with a very typical extrusion setup, used in this case for 3D printing filament (but the setup would look almost the same if they were making slats for Venetian blinds). Notice that there are cooling fans as well as band heaters on the extruder barrel. They control the diameter by adjusting the take-off capstan RPM once the extruder is running well. This extruder looks like it has 4 heat/cool barrel zones and two (heat-only) nozzle zones (6 temperatures total). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40HOAsUnSQ8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40HOAsUnSQ8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extruders are categorized by the barrel bore diameter in inches or mm.

The motors and hotend draw only very little power (around 2A, 5A peak), so the 30A supply you have has significant headroom (it is often recommended to derate a power supply by 20%, so a 30A supply would be good for 24A - you're still well under that).

The mechanical portions include a means to push the filament into a heated nozzle as well as the software portion to regulate the speed of the filament movement. You haven't referenced the heater cartridge and temperature sensor, but you will discover that aspect soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;air tube&quot; you think you've seen is likely called a bowden tube. Such designs permit lighter weight print heads, which is beneficial for speed, acceleration and precision, but has complications with respect to compression of the filament as well as retraction considerations. Non-bowden print heads will have the extruder motor as part of the moving assembly, with the drive wheels very close to the nozzle opening. This allows for flexible filament and more precise control of the filament feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either design has compromises, so one must determine priorities for the design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cooling is also a factor. The heater cartridge is designed to heat the nozzle to a specific temperature for the type of filament used, but also requires a means to keep the heat from traveling to the portion of filament not in the nozzle. You'll discover terms such as heat break, referring to narrow threaded portion connecting the nozzle assembly to the heat sink. There will also be a cooling fan to blow air over the heat sink and very often a cooling fan to cool the filament as it exits the nozzle and attaches to the model being printed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You suggest to ignore the mechanics and software, but it's important to be aware of both when considering the principles of the print head assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simplified, filament enters bowden tube then into heat sink, pushed by extruder motor (or) filament is pushed into heat sink by extruder motor.

Threaded inserts are metal &quot;nuts&quot; with knurled grip extrusions that enable one to use a matching bolt. The insert is heated with a soldering iron or similar source and embedded into the part. It's especially useful when the part thickness provides sufficient strength and the threaded insert is on the surface of the part opposite the bolt head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option you have is to design into the part a &quot;conventional&quot; joint such as a dovetail or slot with the matching dovetail or T shape on the adjoining part. This requires access to the end of the part to enable the sliding action of joining them together, of course. Some testing of prints should be performed to ensure proper mating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Directly related to that method is pins and holes. With suitable testing, one would create a hole on both parts and print a pin to match. If one is well versed in the software of choice, one hole with a built-in pin on the adjoining part would work too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet another extension is provided free from 3DKitbash:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3dkitbash.com/free3dmodels/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.3dkitbash.com/free3dmodels/&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;in the form of friction fit pins.

The pin model with &quot;mouse ears&quot; allows for a bit stronger gripping due to the compression of the shape on insertion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The friction fit pins would be considered to be the snap-fit parts you want to avoid, but the level of expertise should not be beyond that of a model designer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trial and error works wonders when it comes to putting these things together. I printed an Overwatch logo for a fellow makerspace member. The part used a pin on the insert and a hole on the logo. I was astonished when the two different colored parts slid together quite snugly. I have not calibrated my printer and it was indeed a snap together build. On the flip side, when I pried the two pieces apart (low infill) the pin remained in the hole, snapping cleanly off the insert. Should I be asked to do this again, I would have much more infill on the pins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For clarification, consider also to note what software you are using for your design.

Choose a safe material:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider chemical safety and physical safety. Food grade PLA should be chemically safe, but could be too brittle depending on the design you choose.  PETG, T-Glase, or similar filaments (depending on dye) are normally also chemically safe and are less brittle than PLA so may be a better alternative.  ABS is NOT typically considered safe for food contact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Choose a safe design:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If using PLA, be sure the design is robust enough to ensure it won't break.  Broken rattles with sharp edges make baby...sad.  Even less brittle filaments can still break with jagged edges if the design is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2a. Choose a single piece design:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choose a design that requires you to add the peas (or other safe filler) during the print such that the finished rattle is fully enclosed.  This will minimize parts becoming loose or peas spilling and minimize choke hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3. Consider post processing to improve safety:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sanding could reduce ridges and minimize crevices that could harbor bacteria, but sealing it with a food-safe sealant may be more effective.  There are many sealants that the FDA considers safe, but polyurethane or food-safe epoxy finishes will work well with PLA. (If you use a different material, test to verify good adhesion.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4. Test:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make a test rattle and run it through the paces.

Tweaking your Z-height can help you dial-in your first layer adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Print Temperatures:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Higher extruder and bed temps during printing will tend to increase sticking.

This improves surface area for hold down where you need it, but takes minimal post processing to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry your filament:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Warping is generally much worse when filament absorbs water from the air.  Some filaments such as polycarbonate are VERY prone to this, but even PLA warping can be reduced by drying the filament.  To dry your filament you can use a low temperature in your oven, make a drying bucket, or my favorite, put it under a vacuum with a vacuum pump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removal tricks:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Various methods of rapidly cooling the edge of the print with canned air, alcohol, etc. can really help.

I'd suggest using the layer preview in Cura, if the layer doesn't show in the preview, it won't print.  If this is because the leg is too thin for your nozzle diameter, you could increase the scale of the tower, edit the model to have thicker legs, or install a finer nozzle.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Issues with your mesh so Cura skips it.

Your surface does need to be flat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acrylic plate&lt;/strong&gt; will work but is best with no heat, or low heat.  PLA sticks to it.  It's easy to cut and easy to find at local hardware stores.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrap glass&lt;/strong&gt; is fairly easy to find for free and it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cfdrgrOH50Y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;not that hard&lt;/a&gt; to cut...or buy some at your local hardware store and have them cut it.  Just be careful, it's sharp. You can sand the sharp edges (wet sandpaper) to make it safer.  &lt;strong&gt;No, it doesn't have to cover the whole plate, but obviously covering the whole plate would normally be preferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better (but not as fast) solutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy some custom tempered glass.&lt;/strong&gt;  I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onedayglass.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One Day Glass&lt;/a&gt; because they're fast and very capable.  Like Tom says, many many people print on glass because it's nice and flat and stiff.  It's also easy to clean and holds up well.  You can print on the bare glass with many materials or use various preparations like PVA (glue stick or white glue diluted with water are popular), hairspray, or others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Screen Glass:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people like replacement glass for tablets or touch screens because it has a hardened scratch-resistant surface.  I've not tried it, but if you can find one that is the right size, it might be worth a shot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialty products:&lt;/strong&gt; There are many many print bed products out there that promise an easier/better printing experience.  I've used a few that are okay...definitely better than blue painters tape, but I much prefer my current favorite...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My current favorite is PEI.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a 3M 468MP adhesive sheet (it handles the heat well) to stick a thin sheet PEI (also sold under brand name Ultem) on top of your glass plate.  I got this idea from Lulzbot and it's what they use on all of their printers.  It works beautifully.  Common filaments stick to it while it's hot and release easily while it's cool.  For other filaments I just use PVA like I would over glass.  For material printing tips and settings that work well on PEI beds, check out Lulzbot's site.  When it starts wearing out or getting scuffed up, I just sand it with fine sandpaper and I'm good to go for another hundred prints or so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4483" LastActivityDate="2016-10-13T23:35:18.857" CommentCount="0" />

Since 3d printers have moving wires, this is a prime suspect in older machines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rule out all of the easy and cheap stuff before you conclude that it must be the main board...it could be, but it's probably not.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seek help in the Ultimaker forums or with their technical support.  Printers, like cars, tend to have certain things that are more prone to failure as the machines get old and worn.  The Ultimaker techs will know these things and can help you pin down your issue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!

Since you're planning to have a bed which only moves in the Z-axis, build a roller system which feeds a thin, flexible layer of some material (unobtanium, I fear) to cover the build plate. The feed rollers have a weak spring to provide some tension to keep this layer flat but not overly stretched while building the part.  When the part is done, lower the bed to zero while allowing the roller to retract excess parts of the sheet (rollers on both sides of the build plate will have to do this).  At zero, lock down the rollers and move the bed to some negative Z position, causing the overlay sheet to pop free of the bed and ideally pop the printed parts loose as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRhXu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRhXu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;demo concept&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey, it &quot;could&quot; work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2191" LastActivityDate="2016-10-19T15:38:07.340" CommentCount="0" />

Import the STL, select Analysis followed by Dimensions to get the overall information. For point to point, the interface is less intuitive and I would suggest a YouTube search for a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without seeing the part, I cannot suggest a specific sequence. If you are able to visualize the action of stretching the part in a single direction, Meshmixer also allows that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Select Edit, Transform and note the three-axis tool which will appear in the model. Each arrow has a small box at the end. Grab the appropriate box with your mouse and move in the desired direction. It will stretch/distort the model on all surfaces in the direction you move. There will be a digital reference showing during this process, allowing you to more precisely set the increase in thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there are holes in the same plane as the bracket you wish to thicken, they will become longer if on the same axis, or they will distort severely as you increase the thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use Meshmixer to perform a plane cut to separate the model into individual parts to avoid undesired distortion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please provide an image of the model and an indication of the portion you wish to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT after photo and some clarification.

The typical way jams like this are cleared is to do a &quot;cold pull&quot; where you heat up the hot end just enough to be able to pull the plastic out, before it has really had a chance to liquify, hopefully trapping the debris in the plastic, then cut the end of the plastic off and reload. The 90 degree bend in their design may make this very hard if not impossible to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat creep. The tubes are a slightly smaller diameter, and if heat is creeping up the print head and letting the filament expand in these tubes, it may be expanding enough that it will no longer move through the print head. Diagnose this by letting the printer jam, then cool off for a few hours. If you can print again for a short time period before it jams again, this may be your issue, where as an obstructed nozzle would not allow any more filament out. Either turn down your temps, or increase your cooling on the print head to address (or get the original size tubes if possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print head temperatures too low for the print speed. The Stratasys Fortus 250mc I use runs ABS at about 300 degrees. Many of the reprap printers run even higher than this for ABS. The other thing to remember when ever you see people mention what temperatures they use, is that this is relative, and only a guide, as what the temperature reads at the thermocouple or thermistor is usually slightly off from the temperature that is melting the plastic based on heater location in relation to the plastic and thermistor. This can be diagnosed by printing until it jams, pause the print for something like 30 seconds to let the hot end melt more plastic, and then resume printing. If resumes proper printing this may be your issue (and it will jam again shortly if you do not adjust temps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4654" LastActivityDate="2016-10-23T15:16:22.440" CommentCount="0" />

Make sure the nozzle is clear of any debris to avoid the extruded filament form catching and therefore curling around the nozzle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Warping. You might experience more warping on the build plate and de-lamination between layers as a result of the smaller surface area of the layers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reduce speeds. You should reduce your print speeds anyways when printing fine-detail objects. However, the smaller nozzle size will need a bit more time to adhere to other objects (see above).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standoff distance. The distance between the nozzle and build plate, a.k.a standoff, should be a bit smaller with the nozzle size. Typically people use the paper reference (using a piece of paper to &quot;calibrate&quot; the standoff), which is about 0.004&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your slicing engine knows the change! Most slicing software will allow you to adjust the nozzle size. This can also be used to fine-tune your machine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beware of clogging. Clogging is usually a result of poor cooling between your heater block and your drive gear, poor filament quality, and/or incorrect extrusion rates.

There are lots of resources on the internet on how to do this, so I'll spare you the list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase your environment temperature. I highly suggest this because it can help reduce other errors you might encounter throughout the printing process, such as de-lamination, warping, brittleness, etc. I'm not recommending placing a space heater next to your printer (really, don't do that!), but perhaps even a space heater in the room can help regulate the environment temperature a bit better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider other environment variables.

If it's not, as the motor rotates, that offset will&#xA;  be converted into an elliptical motion instead of turning in a perfect&#xA;  circle.  In big CNC world, as the axis is normally bolted to a&#xA;  huge/heavy table which refuses to yield to this movement, it results&#xA;  in breaking your motor or motor coupling (weakest point in the&#xA;  connection). This is what flex couplings are designed to fix – if you&#xA;  can’t guarantee a perfectly square mating between motor and axis, you&#xA;  use a coupler with flex so that any movement can be soaked up in&#xA;  flexing the coupler and the lead screw/rod moves in a nice circle&#xA;  without busting your motor or mounts.  This is true when you have a&#xA;  good solid supported connection on the lead screw like you’d see on a&#xA;  ‘proper’ CNC.  &lt;strong&gt;However on the Solidoodle, as the top end of the Z-Axis&#xA;  is ‘unsupported’ and its only connection to &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is to the table&#xA;  via a tiny little nut, its free to ‘flop about in the breeze’ so to&#xA;  speak.&lt;/strong&gt; Even a small 0.1mm offset from center can result in a much much&#xA;  greater ‘wiggle’ at the top of the screw clearly visible to the eye.&#xA;  Throw in even a 0.05mm bend in the rod, and it gets further amplified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Adding better support to the axis, through a taller nut, multiple&#xA;  nuts, or &lt;strong&gt;supporting the end, would reduce the influence of this&#xA;  wobble. You do however, risk moving it to something else entirely&lt;/strong&gt; –&#xA;  for example, making the lead screw rigid would mean that the forces&#xA;  would end up moving the motor itself, potentially causing fatigue&#xA;  issues with how its bolted to the sheet metal case (mine already moves&#xA;  a fair bit and its ‘stock’... making the screw rigid would see the&#xA;  motor having to absorb all that movement instead of half of it&#xA;  disappearing in movement of the screw...). Solving the motor movement&#xA;  by securing it ‘better’ to the case would mean that the movement now&#xA;  gets soaked up in the motor shaft and bearing, leading to premature&#xA;  stepper motor death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I had originally presumed, when first posting this question, the earlier versions of the model would be superior, as they secured the top of the z-axis screw mechanism, that would reduce the amount of &quot;flapping about&quot; of the loose end, which in turn would result in less wobble. However, I had not bargained for the negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, is the reason that the top brackets of the z-axis, in the version 4 of the frame, lost their threaded rod/leadscrew top-end constraint, therefore to prevent premature motor wear, at the expense of exhibited wobble?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4762" LastEditorUserId="4762" LastEditDate="2017-01-20T06:47:51.920" LastActivityDate="2017-01-20T06:47:51.920" Title="Z axis top brackets, of P3Steel, differ between v1.x/2.x and v4" Tags="&lt;prusa-i3&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="9" FavoriteCount="1" />

If you're willing to do a small amount of cleanup afterwards (to remove the strings and blobs) then printing multiple objects at a time is completely viable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2016-11-14T08:06:48.047" CommentCount="0" />

I have seen designs and variants of printers where the designer did not make the belts parallel to the travel axis (placing the mounting point on the carriage higher/lower than where it come off the pulley/idler) so as you move closer to the pulley/idler the angle starts to change dramatically.  While not extreme, this will introduce error in that axis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;H-Bot/CoreXY - Should not have any issues with a full bed as nothing is changing depending on hotend location.  I know there has been some concern about keeping the gantry square on H-Bot designs due to the way the motors pull when moving in certain directions but I believe that applies to the entire print area.  Both designs will have issues if belt travel is not parallel to axis travel as stated in the cartesian section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delta (Kossel/Rostock) - Have a varying axis resolution depending on the location of the hotend.  As the hotend gets close to an individual tower, the carriage on that tower has to move very little to move the hotend which depending on your pulley selection could affect your print resolution.  The sweet spot for a delta in terms of speed/resolution is the center of the bed.  The center is not the highest resolution but is the largest area where the resolution is relatively stable.

But it can still work. Teflon tube can even be pressed back inside the nest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now because the empty space is heat then filament starts to melt (for example when there is no extrusion for a second) it becomes soft. When filament is soft enough it doesn't extrude as the force to press it throught the nozzle is too high for such soft material so filement definitely stops extruding itself.

On the flip side of this point is the fact that you have a working STL from which to build. Meshmixer will enable you to extrude the portions that sit below the surface level and create a flat plane. You can also &quot;bridge&quot; the elevated portions into a plane, but only if you remove the lower panels first. Leaving them in place creates an unprintable model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Meshmixer has its own learning curve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along the same train of thought, Blender (free) is suited for performing similar tasks, again aimed at organic models. Again, starting with your STL makes it less of a complication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in my opinion, Blender's learning curve is substantially steeper, as the program does many things unrelated to 3d printing. It has spectacular control over the model and if you are able to learn the necessary controls and sequences, there isn't anything you can't do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meshmixer is more intuitive than Blender and therefore easier to learn. You may also find it easier to find YouTube resources for Meshmixer actions than similarly for Blender, mostly because the phrasing of your search will be clearer with Meshmixer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, one would create face groups of your STL. Various segments would then turn colors. You select the depressed face group and say, &quot;cheer up&quot; then delete that group. Using the appropriate tool, which currently escapes my alleged mind, you'd then bridge those faces remaining after the delete. What was once a shallow pool becomes a flat contiguous surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend using Lynda.com tutorial material if you can find it.

Given that you will have a bunch of wires in a bundle, this may cause them to heat up more than if they were in free air.

CAT6 cables have the wires twisted in pairs of 2. Some people recommend to take advantage of these pairs: the +12V and GND of the heater should use a pair, each of the two coils of the steppers should have their own separate pairs. The reasoning behind this is that with equal current flowing in opposite directions in each wire of the pair, the generated electromagnetic fields will cancel out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twisted pairs are usually used when dealing with multiple pairs of wires that are carrying high frequency signals that might affect each other.

If you are paranoid, then make micro adjustments with the power turned off, and then turn back on to check the behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: it should go without saying that one should &lt;strong&gt;never disconnect a stepper whilst the power is on&lt;/strong&gt;, as both the driver and the stepper motor may be irrevocably damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The photo above is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bootsindustries.com/pots-calibration-ramps-1-4/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;POTs Calibration – RAMPS 1.4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If a POT is set too high then the associated stepper driver will tend to overheat and go into over-temperature thermal shutdown (to prevent damage to its components). The first sign of overheating is erratic stepper motor behavior. Typically, this can be recognized by the sounds of the stepper motor suddenly losing power (thermal shutdown). If no load or movement is required of the motor, it is hard to detect whether it is over-powered as the driver is barely producing any heat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Conversely, if the POT is set too low, the stepper motor can enter an underpowered state. This can be recognized by a lack of holding torque and a stepper motor that is skipping steps because the necessary movement  requires a higher power demand than the POT setting allows for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Driver cooling&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the possibility of the stepper motor over heating, it could be possible that the stepper driver is overheating, although the symptoms may be different, to those that you are experiencing. Regardless, you may still find it advantageous to cooler the controller/driver board with a fan that is always on (not temperature controlled).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Additional reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RigidWiki - &lt;a href=&quot;http://rigidtalk.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stepper_Driver_Adjustment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stepper Driver Adjustment&lt;/a&gt;, which goes into further detail about the adjustment of the potentiometers, that I outlined above, as well as the &lt;em&gt;reference voltage&lt;/em&gt; and the adjustment thereof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RepRap Wiki - &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Setting_Motor_Currents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;RepRapPro Setting Motor Currents&lt;/a&gt; describes a different controller to yours, but goes into the process of adjustment, and description of the &lt;em&gt;reference voltage&lt;/em&gt; (which is applicable to all boards):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The wiper on each potentiometer generates a DC voltage that is sent to the chip. This is the reference voltage; it defines how much current the stepping motor driver chip supplies to the motor. The bigger the reference voltage (VREF), the higher the current (A) that the chip will send to the motor. For most NEMA14 motors, the current maximum is 1A, but this will generally cause it to get warm, so a setting of 750mA is recommended. For NEMA17 motors, depending on size, the limit on current is generally between 1.3A and 1.7A. If you drive stepper motors with more current than they were designed for, the motor will get hot, and may be damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pololu - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pololu.com/product/1183&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier with Voltage Regulators&lt;/a&gt; - this is a very common stepper driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyHomeFab - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.my-home-fab.de/epages/64756193.mobile/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/64756193/Categories/Dokumentationen/Technische_Beschreibungen/DRV8825_Schrittmotor_Strom_einstellen&amp;amp;Locale=en_GB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DRV8825 Adjust Stepper Current&lt;/a&gt; goes into the adjustment of the reference voltage, for the commonly used DRV8825, which is an alternative to the popular A4988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thread, about non-actuating steppers, may also be useful, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?41,219920&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Motors&lt;/a&gt;, which mentions &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?41,219920,222621#msg-222621&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;setting the trimpots&lt;/a&gt; and points the OP to RepRap Wiki - &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Pololu_stepper_driver_board&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pololu stepper driver board&lt;/a&gt;, which, in turn, refers to this thread, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?4,116813,116832,quote=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Strange stepper behavior&lt;/a&gt; and this video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MsOBW3lnjnI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;video-2012-02-02-16-37-26.mp4&lt;/a&gt;, which describes a jitter in the stepper behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4762" LastEditorUserId="4762" LastEditDate="2016-12-13T08:36:59.493" LastActivityDate="2016-12-13T08:36:59.493" CommentCount="3" />

All the parts were individual STL files and were positioned in 3-space using MeshMixer to make the parts appear as if the project were printed and assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transform tool in Meshmixer is a graphic three-arrow/three-axis manipulator icon. Grab an arrow tip and the model moves in the direction of the drag. Grab an arc between two arrows and the model rotates. If you want five degree rotation increments, move the mouse outward after the grab and get a calibration circle. When the mouse is on the circle, you get snaps to five degrees. If you need smaller movement, move the mouse out even farther from the center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 3-space presented in Meshmixer gives you the ability to align pieces/parts in all three dimensions, to your satisfaction. There is a model hide and a model-ghost feature as well, to assist the placement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expect that one could use a program such as Blender, but the learning curve is more like a chasm or cliff-face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could use an engineering-focus program such as SolidWorks, Fusion 360 and so many others, but I think your head, arms, legs, torso reference means you aren't using orthogonal models more suited to those programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meshmixer, like OpenSCAD is free.

However, it usually starts at 20k USD for the tooling for injection molding. Your costs could be a fraction of that or could be several times that. This is just a generality.

You have several issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 You will likely note while it prints, the pillar will almost catch and sometimes twang as the layers get higher and higher. Issue here is you are over extruding a bit and the head is dragging on the print. Add some leverage and then you get this strange pattern. Letting it cool more between layers or by adding a fan will also help. A small pillar like this will not have much time to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or it could be that your Z is not straight. Whats the name of this test? Right the Z resonance test. Check out your smooth rods and screws and see if they are perfect or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 Hmm maybe some oozing / over extrusion. I mean it will never be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3 Looks good to me. You are printing PLA not ABS?. Looking at your temps and I hope you are doing ABS.. Which probably should bridge a bit better. That said even my highly calibrated machines would have a hard time with a bridge like that. I've been at this for years. Fan will help. Different material will help. I mean you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; printing over air. That said 1-2 degrees will make a difference. Try slowing it down. Try lowering temp. Add that fan. Remember every spool will need a new perfect temp. Even a different color will need calibration as the pigments change the temperature profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last over all, simplify 3d seems to really help. I rarely spend time calibrating these days. Albeit they cost a lot. &lt;em&gt;no affiliation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also like this visual guide &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Print_Troubleshooting_Pictorial_Guide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://reprap.org/wiki/Print_Troubleshooting_Pictorial_Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT. I see you have added more photos!&#xA;For the Z axis, I stick with my first assessment. Over-extrusion. Or it could just be getting too hot the higher you go. Maybe add a min time between layers option if your slicer supports it. Fan is good too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;XY resonance.. Tricky tricky. My research shows this can be solved by using a different slicer program. You will have to research how to solve this with your preferred program. Maybe try to tighten belts, and tweek your oozebane settings. I would also play with acceleration and Jerk at the Firmware level.. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last one, Bridging.

Use a thermocouple on a multimeter, non-contact probe, etc. to verify your nozzle temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature: Nozzle temperature 'sag' of +/- 5 degrees is normal. Monitor nozzle temperature during a print to see if it stays within this range (see: Speed below). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed: Printing fast is awesome... when you have a hotend that can keep-up with the demands of melting incoming filament. Too fast, and the filament may not be properly melted; increasing the pressure needed to force it through the nozzle. Support material and infill typically print faster than the rest of the model - you mentioned hearing clicks &quot;...mostly during filling areas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alignment: Make sure the hobbed gear, idler bearing, and filament are properly aligned. Filament that wanders around in the feed path is much more likely to slip and/or buckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teeth: Make sure that the teeth of the hobbed gear are clean and clear of debris. 'Gunk' in hobbed gear teeth reduce grip on the filament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tension: Increase the tension between the hobbed gear and idler bearing if possible; worn hobbed gears may need a little extra help holding-on to the filament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepper: Heat generated by the stepper motor can be passed down to the hobbed gear... softening the filament and causing it to slip.

Passive cooling (heatsink) is a good idea, active cooling (fan) is better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A loose heat-break, nicks in the filament path, variations in filament width, etc. are all possibilities as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, Simplify3D created a great reference for solutions to common 3D printing problems (if you haven't seen it already). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5244" LastActivityDate="2016-12-14T21:12:54.560" CommentCount="0" />

There are entries for Infill. I usually print with 7% infill. AKA my print is 93% hollow inside. I then set a few solid shell layers. Think of solid shells as the skin. Usually that is enough to reduce my plastic usage. The only reason I don't make a part 100% hollow and a few solid skin / shell layers is that I need something to print on top of or if I need the part to be strong . Even low percent infill can be very strong if the correct geometric pattern is used (I.E. triangles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally the reduced infill will be enough, unless you are making thousands of this item, though in that case you are probably not going to 3d print it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHLTZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHLTZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprintingforbeginners.com/infill-strength/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3dprintingforbeginners&lt;/a&gt; has a nice article on the relationship between infill, number of shells and part strength.

I've clocked about 60 hours on a new Replicator+ w/ Smart Extruder+ and haven't encountered any of the issues I heard about with the original extruder.

In the past, if there was too much tension on the filament and the drive gear was not adjusted correctly, the drive gear would grind the filament. This would lead to small deposits of filament gumming up the drive gear, eventually leading to the filament slipping. Once the filament began slipping, it would slowly no longer extrude and heat up further up the extruder assembly. This inevitably leads to the extruder becoming clogged. In short:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;{Too much filament tension} + {Too tight drive gear} = Gumming&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;{Too much gumming} + Time = Slipping/&quot;Thinning&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;{Too much slipping} + time + heat = Clogging&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-12-20T21:41:20.230" CommentCount="0" />

I would just add:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't draw anywhere near that much power from the normal heatbed output on a PC board like RAMPs. You could, however, use the normal output to control a big relay (semiconductor or not); that also lets you keep the high-power wiring away from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll want multiple temperature sensors and heat zones, for at least 2 reasons: First, variation may be high over such an area; and second, you can save a lot of power by only powering up the portions you're going to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, just like with home heating, having multiple zones makes things much more complicated. The software for managing heatbed temperature isn't likely to support multiple heaters (especially since most cards don't have enough outputs to make use of it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've done a bit with this since my printer is about 4x as long as normal (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; 4x as wide too, like yours). So far I just use one standard PC-board heatbed, and if I have to print something longer than that I do without the heatbed entirely (mine is easy to take in and out). Present plan is to get a few more of the same PC-board heaters, and have an entirely separate box with temperature dials to control each one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that still means the printer software won't be in control. So I couldn't (for example), have a different temp for the first few layers, or have the print stop if the heatbed gets out of range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put the printer back in charge, I'd have to do something like calculate the average (or maximum?) temperature of the zones, and create a signal that looks like what a thermistor or thermocouple would generate, to send to the printer software. The software would then turn the heat on or off as usual, but that output would go to the control box, which would decide what specifically to do about it. For example, even when the printer says to turn off, the heat control might keep the cooler zones on until they catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it gets pretty messy... :( &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastActivityDate="2016-12-21T22:05:12.647" CommentCount="0" />

A vertical circle will have steps introduced by the slicing which quantises X and Y from layer to latyer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sharp, un-supported corners may be the weakest aspect to resolve in the print - extruded filament tends to shrink as it cools, but as far as I know the errors like this can be reduced by printing more slowly (and reducing the dynamic flexing of the frame too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talking about a top surface of an extruded n-gon, if you look at the slicing output, you'll see infill in the bulk, with a layer filling only the top 3 or 4 layers. There are several infill patern options, but yes, there is scope for a scenario where the top layer needs to bridge a long way. However, since the alternate layers fill in orthogonal directions this should be a minimal effect. Tweaking the infill percentage, or chamfering the corners can fix these small defects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4927" LastActivityDate="2016-12-24T12:26:35.733" CommentCount="1" />

Binding usually happens when your carriage is not level. Take a bubble leveler and verify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another time it happens is when your Acceleration / Jerk settings are too high. Try reducing the Acceleration for Z in the firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is your rod is Bent. Take the rod on a flat surface. Inspect it as you roll it around. Do the same with the other rod. If it bows and is not completely flat, then you will need to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last is make sure your printers frame is put together. If it is causing the rod to bend as it is not aligned right then you should try to see if you can fix it and contact the seller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically you can run without the second rod.

This is because you will generally want to make sure the first layer is nicely squished into the build platform so that it sticks properly. By doing this the plastic gets squished out into a thicker line than normal and thus the bottom of the print will bulge out a bit like an elephant's foot. You can decrease this effect by leveling your bed so that the nozzle is slightly further away from the bed and lowering the bed temperature a bit. It's hard to get rid of this effect entirely without sacrificing bottom layer quality and bed adhesion. It will be easier on small prints as they are less likely to warp and detach from the platform and you can therefore get away with not squishing the first layer as hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;See this visual guide on more information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are seeing this on all layers.

I don't think that's the problem you're experiencing but worth mentioning.

It reads the heat block temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below a certain throughput, the temperature of the filament will have time to equalize with the temperature of the heat block before it leaves the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For those slow speeds, heat block temperature should be set exactly to the material's optimal printing temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For greater speeds, however, heat block temperature will always have to be higher than the mark, because the filament doesn't have time to equalize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At that point, it becomes a balancing act. Find the best heat block temperature (°C) given a rate of throughput (mm³/s), the optimal printing temperature for a given material (°C), the volume of the melting zone (mm³) and &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt; some other property of the material &gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which determines how fast it heats up. I don't know what that last property is, nor can I come up with the proper unit. The material probably approaches the temperature of the environment asymptotically. This is where thermodynamics comes in, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, running filament also cools down the heat block, but we can ignore this.

However I would like to mention that chances are that the random spool you pickup from most stores, especially no name brands, are either completely lying to you about its material or is mixed / cut with cheaper fillers. All about finding a good brand. Course rarely does one actually need pure PLA, a mixed material will often perform as well without you even noticing. Aside from the temp difference. Not to say it is right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the trick is this. While I don't advise ever breathing in potentially carcinogenic plastic smoke. You take a lighter. Burn it.

However, while PLA might seem like a better overall choice at first glance, it features a far lower melting point than ABS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also not responsible if you burn yourself or your property. At your own risk. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just warming it with lighter might work too. But just burning a small section. It will be real clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or you could just drop a bit into aceton and see if it melts. PLA will mostly just look like crud after being treated is aceton. ABS is 100% dissolve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see from these forums that PETG does not dissolve via Aceton. So you can test you material. If it does disolve it is ABS. If it smells sweet when burned it is PLA.

Maybe need to calibrate your PIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have it dialed in, all you will need to do is calibrate the temp when switching materials. Remember you need to calibrate even between different colors (okay its best to.. I often skip) I usually do the temp adjustments live on the printer. Increase and degrease a few degrees.

To achieve higher speeds you need to make the resins more reactive.  Making resins more reactive means the resins won't last as long in the vat/bottle.  So they expire sooner.

Unfortunately, the quality:price ratio is as to be expected here. My reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PTFE has great thermal properties for a polymer, just like ABS. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;glass-transition state&lt;/a&gt; begins at relatively the same temperature between the two materials.

In recycled PTFE, you can lose a lot of the desired properties in the material (true for any material). This includes both the ideal &quot;friction-less&quot; and thermal resistance we need in 3D Printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I think happened:&lt;/strong&gt; The higher print temperatures of ABS transitioned the PTFE into its glass-state. As the throat expands, the path of least resistance in the assembly is towards the extruder motor since the nozzle holds more pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would not recommend &quot;fixing&quot; this problem with a retainer!&lt;/strong&gt; By forcing the PTFE throat to stay in position, you could potentially force the PTFE to expand in other ways. Most likely resulting in constricting the filament, leading to grinding of filament on the drive gear and clogging of the nozzle. Worst case, you end up with gooey PTFE in your nozzle and/or around your retainer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2017-01-09T16:14:49.627" CommentCount="0" />

What resolution are you seeking? Layer thickness of 0.100 mm is quite good, allowing for ten layers per mm of part thickness, with infill adjusted as required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you've already determined that your printer will not print at the resolution required for your gear design, you would perhaps purchase a higher resolution printer. Of course, that may be an expense you would like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your parts count is small, you could consider to print samples of the parts to confirm fit, but not worry about strength and then use an online service to have them printed via SLS method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selective Laser Sintering places nylon powder on the work surface, then selectively melts the powder into a solid. Each layer when completed is covered with another layer of powder and fused to the previous portion (or not) until the part is complete. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the un-fused powder provides support, there is no requirement for the model to have supplemental support structures. There is a requirement/objective that the part have &quot;drain holes&quot; in areas which might otherwise be solid. Any surface that entraps powder is charged to the purchaser as if the space within is included in the part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example would be a cube that can be printed as six square faces only. The cube wall thickness can be specified and if a drain hole is incorporated, the cost would be the volume of the walls only. No drain hole would mean the cube would be charged for the entire volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For gears, which are typically low profile/flat items, that's a minor consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same concept applies to SLA printing, which uses a laser in a vat of resin. If the model is a solid with no drain holes, the interior will retain the resin. It is possible that the interior can be cured with strong UV light and/or sunlight, but opaque resins would not accept this work-around, nor would it reduce the cost involved. Also note that SLA printed items would lack the necessary strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If farming out your parts is the direction you intend to travel, ensure the dimension stability reference in the vendor you use. Nylon sintered parts will shrink a known amount during the fusing process.

You could use a countersink of the same diameter as the outside diameter of the threads. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Center drills are available with 60 degree angles as well:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00M54BPRQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Amazon specific item&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6edXI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6edXI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second smallest center drill listed here has a 1.5mm center point with a 4mm drill point. If your coupling is larger than 4mm, the next size up will not work as well, as the center point is 2.5mm. You'd have to resort to a countersink only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are near a machine shop or have a friend with a mill or even a decent drill press, those resources may be able to perform the countersink for a minimal (or possibly zero) fee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a mini-mill and a collection of countersinks as well as center drills. I found my bag of unused couplers. They are for 5mm tubing and were flat on the threaded end. This is the result after a quick trip to the mill. It appears in the close up that I could have driven the center drill deeper into the fitting, and also cleaned off the swarf a bit as well. If you like, I can send you a pair with the drilling a bit deeper if the tubing size is correct, in exchange for your pair of unmodified couplers. I'm hopeful there's a PM option in the SE system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6WTO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6WTO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="854" LastEditorUserId="854" LastEditDate="2017-01-15T22:55:53.047" LastActivityDate="2017-01-15T22:55:53.047" CommentCount="1" />

Mine were very fine lines. That lead me down a series of different search terms until I found some other videos that talked about nozzle cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed that one of the symptoms they mentioned was that when the plastic would come out of the nozzle that it would curve around. That's a sign that it's partially blocked and causing it to bend and curve. After the people in the YouTube videos cleaned their nozzle, the plastic would then extrude and drop straight down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If my nozzle was partially blocked and only about half the right amount of plastic was coming out that would make sense since there wouldn't be enough surface area of the plastic to make a good connection to the build surface. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I acquired some &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CCF46EQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;0.4mm drill bits from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doqlEsssz1g&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when using the 0.4mm drill bits, I could tell the nozzle was clogged.

Even if there was not a power outage, maybe there was a temporary dip in power that caused the power supply to be unable to supply the required voltage (or perhaps the power supply was of poor quality to begin with and suffered some issue that caused the voltage to drop).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that you were printing via a computer, and the computer rebooted during the print.

I use a PEI print surface on my Monoprice Maker Select (Wanhao Di3), which has an 8.5&quot;x8.5&quot; build plate, and I've had no issues with the PEI coming unstuck.  However, instead of attaching mine directly to the aluminum heated build plate, I attached it (using 3M 468) to a piece of Borosilicate glass, which is then attached to my aluminum build plate using silicone thermal heatsink pads.  The rational for using a Borosilicate glass print surface is that a heated metal build surface is going to warp or move some, as the heat is coming from one side; the glass will not warp and so you have a completely flat surface on which to print (and the heatsink pads help make up the difference in surface geometry).  I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinterwiki.info/wiki/wanhao-duplicator-i3/duplicator-i3-basic-mods/adding-a-glass-bed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this 3dprinterwiki article&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for my glass bed mod, and applied the PEI/adhesive using another source (which I've forgotten, possibly &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/PEI_build_surface&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the RepRap wiki&lt;/a&gt;).  While the first link is Wanhao Di3 specific, it covers the idea.  Make sure you tweak your z-endstops if needed on your particular machine, as adding the glass plat raises the bed height by several mm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I'm theorizing - I did not ever try applying my PEI directly to my aluminum build plate, so I have no direct comparison.

It's really all about heat being added to the system at the same rate that it's leaving.  The heat block is there as a heat reservoir from which the filament draws heat for the glass transition.  The heat in that reservoir is maintained by cycling the heating coil to add energy (more heat) to the systems as it's lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the very local vicinity of the nozzle, the temperature will decrease slightly as it's being transferred to the filament, but because the heat block is massive in comparison to that drain, and because the heat block is a good thermal conductor that temperature reduction is very small.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know what tolerance and hysteresis are built into the temp controller, but think the variation is likely small.  The difference in additional heat required (more energy into the system) for any practical difference in feed rates (40 instead of 60) is thus likely to be very small compared to the filament cooling experienced immediately after it leaves the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: the adjustment you would want to make is not to increase the temp, but increase the duty cycle of the heating element to maintain the desired temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4627" LastActivityDate="2017-01-21T17:49:16.750" CommentCount="4" />

Layer Time (sec)     : 10&#xA;Enable cooling fan        : Yes&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do most of my printing with a later height of 0.2mm, but for a detailed mini, 0.1mm is probably the largest that will look good (and probably the smallest possible on this printer.  I normally set most of my speeds to 50 mm/s, with first layer at 20 mm/s; for this I slowed it all to 20 mm/s due to the fine details, and I think it helped.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temps of 67˚C bed and 210˚C extruder are what I've found to work best on my machine for PLA, after much experimentation, but your machine may vary; I'm not sure how accurate the temperature measurements are on these machines.  67˚C gives me an observed bed temp of 60˚C, but that's at the top surface - I have PEI atop Borosilicate glass, adhered to the bare aluminum bed with silicone-based heat transfer pad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I miscalculated the top/bottom heights and infill.  I'm not used to printing at 0.1mm layer height, but 3 top layers over 20% infill is clearly not enough - see the closeup of the mini's base in my linked gallery.  Next print, I'll either try 0.6mm top/bottom, or much higher infill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supports came off easily; I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00FZPDG1K&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a pair of sidecutters from my electronics bench&lt;/a&gt;.  A little more cleanup with a sharp hobby knife, combined with a better base top layer would probably produce an acceptable result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were two major flaws.  The first are the little blobs on many layers; see for example the inseam area on the picture of the knight's back.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://softsolder.com/2012/01/26/reversal-zits-speed-acceleration-and-a-bestiary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ed Nisley at Softsolder.com calls these &quot;Reveral Zits&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and I think the name is apt.  These happen when the print head needs to quickly reverse direction or stop-move-print, but filament continues to extrude.  I use fairly aggressive retraction settings, and I think my print shows smaller zits than yours, but still far too many.  Ed has explored this topic in some depth; it's possible my extruder stepper isn't keeping up with my settings due to mechanical limits.  This is an area I want to pursue, but I don't have time at the moment.  I plan to read Ed's work and try some experiments on my machine to see if I can get better results; I will update this answer if/when I do.  As it stands, most of them are quite small, and could probably be cleaned up with a knife; the worst are those around unsupported areas, such as the back of the shoulder guard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second major flaw is the helmet.  It's just... bad.  I'm not sure the printer has much hope of nailing those horns, but overall the head is just bad.  I'm not sure what can be done there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize:  @disc0ninja's advice on Bed Level and Print speed are certainly the right place to start; You might want to try my Cura settings to see if you get similar results.  Also, the Z-brace mod I linked to above has made a big difference for me; I rarely have to adjust my leveling anymore.  I also plan to try slicing with Slic3r, which I haven't used previously, but have been looking into.  You mentioned you couldn't print with Slic3r, was that USB or SD Card?  I'd suggest trying via SD if it failed during USB printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 30 Jan 2017:&lt;/strong&gt;  It took a little doing, but I managed to slice and print this model via slic3r.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3482/slicer-reports-1000s-of-errors-not-seen-in-cura-render-is-missing-big-chunks&quot;&gt;I had some issues with the original STL in slic3er&lt;/a&gt;, which I ended up fixing with a free trial at makeprintable.com.  I spent a lot of time fiddling with slic3r; it has a lot more knobs to turn than Cura, and I make no claims of having the best settings for this print.  There are so many settings that rather than transcribe them here, I've captured them in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/Nw0Gv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pictures of the slic3er print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I feel like the quality is higher.  The &quot;reversal zits&quot; are hardly noticeable; but the big remaining problem is one I didn't fully diagnose in the original Cura print - lack of support for areas such as the shoulders.  Slic3r added more support than Cura, but it's also harder to separate from the base.  The head isn't great, but much better than the Cura print; I don't think my photos show it as well as it looks.  &lt;strong&gt;This print has convinced me that there's plenty of quality still to be wrung from this printer&lt;/strong&gt;; I hope to make time to do some more slic3r prints of this model while tweaking the params to see what's possible.  If I make any big leaps in quality I will update this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2541" LastEditorUserId="2541" LastEditDate="2017-01-31T02:54:58.833" LastActivityDate="2017-01-31T02:54:58.833" CommentCount="0" />

I have experienced this problem with both the stock configuration along with an E3D The Chimera. Sometimes, when I am printing and connect a mains device, my printer will fail in some way. The first time this happened I was printing with ABS, so I connected my fume sucker (A ~25-50W fan) to an outlet.

Looking at the firmware, this seems to be caused by a thermistor failure. I had everything plugged into the same setup as before, except for a surge protector at the end. The circuit that it is connected to has a 20A circuit breaker, with probably ~3A of it constantly used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My theory for this is that an additional device causes a slight fluctuation in the thermistor wires, causing an error to occur. However, the Rostock Max is designed so that wires are inside of aluminum tubes, which I think would provide EMF protection. The power supply is a generic 12V 30A power supply that was included in the kit, usually seen in LED strips. Both of these occurred while printing.

For example, the screw terminals on RAMPs board are only rated for up to 12A. That would be okay at 24V, but well over the limit at 12V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the wire gauge is dependent on current, you can also use somewhat thinner wires with a 24V system (or equivalently: wires that would melt in a 12V setup won't in a 24V setup). The power dissipated in a wire scales quadratically with current, so the same wire being used in a 24V setup would only waste a quarter of the heat of that wire in a 12V setup. There is also less strain on switching devices (such as MOSFETs or relays).

It is very translucent but it is not clear and no amount of post treatment will make it 100% clear. Their example is the only exception where you have a simple print where it has only a single layer. By applying the clear coating they have normalized the wall and made the surface even. Thus no more light diffusion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could likely get the same effect with good sanding but good luck sanding a 1 wall thick print. Also note they do not show any solid parts. If they cannot get a solid part to look good and clear, then really you shouldn't expect to be able to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any infill will cause it to be non clear. Any extra shells will also create air pockets, lines, etc and make it non clear. If you really want clear, FDM is not the way to go.

If the extruder is spring loaded, then it should adjust itself to the thicker filament, without a problem. If not, then you may have to do a slight manual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, after doing some further reading, there may be other factors that need to be considered, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Extruder gearing;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Melt time (which would imply a different feed rate)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be worth having a close look at the aperture of your hotend. If, in the unlikely situation, it looks as if the hotend would accept 3 mm (or if you could remove the lining so that it can), you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not need to actually change any hardware, but instead just try tweeking the &lt;strong&gt;feedrate&lt;/strong&gt; in the software, because as your nozzle is less than the width of the filament anyway, then it will be fine for both 1.75 mm &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 3 mm. A 3 mm filament would require more heating, and therefore a slower feedrate than a 1.75 mm feedrate. Once the filament has melted, so long as the pressure from the extruder is sufficient, then the molten filament should come out of the nozzle. However, this may be a less than satisafctory method and result in some dubious prints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting thread on the RepRap wiki, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,128719,page=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1.75mm Filament vs 3mm Filament&lt;/a&gt;, that discusses most of the points above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the advantages of 3 mm filament has over 1.75 mm are that it is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cheaper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;stiffer (less flexible) and thus &quot;easier&quot; to push through the hotend.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one interesting point raised in the thread, is that maybe a smaller extruder can be used, for the narrower 1.75 mm filament, thus resulting in a lighter print head.

This, and the tension in the belt, ensures the belt always engages the pulley tightly. A belt and pulley system is thus relatively forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a rack and pinion system, only a few teeth engage at any given time. To avoid backlash and get the same kind of &quot;tight&quot; engagement, both the gear and the rack need to be made with very high precision. The carriage also needs to be very well constrained, because any wobble of the rack relative to the gear introduces backlash (or binding). Moreover, you also need to keep the rack and pinion well lubricated lest they wear out prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that belt and pulley work well enough, I don't see why you'd need to move to rack and pinion. The main advantage of rack and pinion is that the rack isn't elastic.

Although PLA has a much lower shrinkage factor than ABS, both can warp and curl, potentially ruining a print.  There are some very common ways to deal with this potential problem, the most notable being a heated build platform.  However, sometimes that might not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a heated build platform.  A heated build platform helps keep the lowest levels of a print warm as the higher layers are printed.  This allows the overall print to cool more evenly.  A heated build platform, sometimes abbreviated as HBP, helps tremendously with just about any ABS print and large PLA prints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print with a raft.  Rafts are a printing option in ReplicatorG and Skeinforge.  They’re basically a large flat lattice work of printed material underneath the lower-most layer of your printed object.  They’ll also help reduce warping and curling by allowing your printed object to adhere better to your flat build surface.  Other variations on this are to print with a larger raft and/or a thicker raft comprised of more layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calibrate your starting Z height.  A good first layer makes all the difference.  If your starting Z axis height is too high, the extruded filament won’t be able to make a good bond with the platform.  If you think your Z axis starting height is too high, try lowering it by 0.05mm increments until you find a good first layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the right build surface.  Some people have experimented with different surfaces such as steel, titanium, glass, different kinds of plastic, different kinds of tape, and foam board.  However, I find both ABS and PLA seem to stick really well to hot or warm Kapton tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean your build surface.  ABS and PLA stick better to a clean build surface.  Keep it clean of dust, pieces of old prints, and any other debris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print slower.  Printing slower allows finer detail, better adhesion to the build surface and lower layers, and gives the printed part more time to cool evenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print cooler.  Printing at a lower temperature isn’t always an option.  Ideally, you should be printing at the lowest temperature required for extrusion and that allows good interlayer adhesion.  However, trying lower temperatures isn’t for the faint of heart.  Printing at a too low a temperature could cause harm to your extruder motor or extruder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate drafts or enclose your robot.  Forrest Higgs found that having his 3D printer too close to an open window caused very uneven heating across his build surface.  This in turn caused the side of his prints closest to the window to curl.  Since keeping the window closed wasn’t an option for him, he compensated for the window drafts by adding a heat lamp.  Cupcake and Thing-O-Matic owners might have an easier time of eliminating drafts by simply enclosing two or three of the sides of their robots.  It will also have a fortunate side effect of helping to control fumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design with mouse ears.  Zach Smith’s solution was to add little discs to corners of an object to help those corners stick to the platform.  These essentially serve as “mini-rafts” to give those corners more surface area and better adhesion without having to print an entire raft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design with aprons to hold down corners.  Forrest Higgs suggested adding “aprons” around an object to be printed, while that object was being printed on a raft.  These low thick pieces of plastic help keep the raft flat and help prevent any curling or warping from affecting the desired printed object itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design with surrounding thermal walls.  While Forrest Higgs’ apron approach provides a mechanical advantage of essentially holding down corners with a chunk of plastic, Nophead has added thin surrounding walls to his designs to act as baffles to keep warm air around the printed object as it moves around.  He’s postulated that a very thin surrounding wall could have the same beneficial effect as printing inside an enclosed build chamber.  Interestingly, it seems that Nophead suggests that designing objects with more rounded corners might also help avoid curling and warping at those corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce infill.  When printing a model you can chose to print it hollow, completely solid, or some percentage between zero and 100.  However, as Nophead points out even the plastic inside a model exerts a force on the entire printed object as it cools.  It stands to reason that the more plastic you have, the more those pieces of plastic will pull against themselves and the build surface as they cool.  By reducing infill there will a reduced amount of internal tension as the object cools.  Reducing these internal forces by printing with a lower infill ratio can help reduce curling and warping as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5962" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T08:33:32.490" CommentCount="3" />

Heavier extruders need lower values, as well a slower jerk values, to avoid the motors skipping. The jerk setting being set lower can actually be beneficial, as this makes for smoother extrusion after a corner or a hole (some people will see ripples near these areas as it accelerates out of the direction change - lower values make these ripples smaller, but slightly increase print time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've just modified mine with a prototype carriage design that I'm working on. It's added about 100 grams to the stock weight. It was finely tuned before, so this extra weight set it over that pillow of 20-30% in the setting, and makes the X and Y skip as it jerks around the plate; especially in high resolution models, particularly high resolution circles with 200 faces on the vertical axis, because the printer tries to jerk after each node - normally that isn't an issue, but in heavy designs, the jerk setting needs to be lowered. I had my jerk at 20 for XY, and its now at 4, after having tested and failed 8 and 15 values. The acceleration was at 2000 for both extrusion and travel (some firmwares don't allow separate values for travel and extrusion moves, but if yours does, it's best to have travel value about double the print moves - when your travel is twice the speed of extrusion moves - so use that 1-1 formula in relation to speed, scale it for each desired speed set in the slicer). Mine has been tested at 2000, 1500, 1000, and 800, failing all of them, with jerk setting of 5. Now testing 500 for acceleration, and beginning to get a little confused as to why this is happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm having second thoughts... After going as low as 800 from 2000, and still getting skipping (seemingly worse) am I getting this backwards here? Do I need a higher value if the motor is skipping on quick moves? My understanding is that lower is better for those problems, but perhaps I've confused myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6030" LastEditorUserId="4762" LastEditDate="2017-02-16T20:31:56.920" LastActivityDate="2017-02-16T20:31:56.920" CommentCount="1" />

It depends somewhat on your printer, but you can get very uniform results in terms of material density with the issues in die fairness being limited to problems with the surfaces (e.g. the sides aren't usually all the same texture).  You can fix this with statistical modelling and sanding to get a very good die, but it takes forever and is a huge pain and is totally not worth it from a practical standpoint.  A quick sanding to get all faces roughly the same texture is usually good enough, in my experience.  You can also just print the die so that the build-surface face and the face parallel with it (if it's not a d4) are unimportant faces, like the '10' and '11' on a d20-- being smoother they'll be rolled a little less often but the average roll will be the same regardless of what number pair that effects if you keep the 'opposite sides sum to die size + 1' rule.  A quick sanding doesn't take too long and works well, though; that's definitely what I would recommend from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a note, the main &lt;em&gt;advantage&lt;/em&gt; in 3d printing dice is that it's affordable, whereas otherwise acquiring truly custom dice (weighted to specification, unusual number of sides, etc) requires you to make them by hand or shell out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.awesomedice.com/blog/545/custom-dice-manufacturing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;many thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.  3d printed dice are particularly useful when you want to concoct biased dice, as you can easily alter things like the physical die size, weight (by altering how much of the interior is hollow), weight distribution (by altering &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the hollow cavities are-- known as 'floaters' when these gaps are used to bias the roll, much less good than weighting), and number placement to conceal the differences between your die and a 'fair' die you 3d printed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, 3d printed dice work fine for RPGs, but feel a little light (at least with my feedstock).

Triangles are especially good at being &lt;em&gt;rigid&lt;/em&gt;, while hex grids are very material-efficient for a given strength. The second reason ($) is typically more important for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Triangles do have fewer vertices than squares, but it's not always true that &quot;fewer vertices&quot; means stronger. Vertices are one kind of weak point. But in a triangle, vertex &quot;angle-holding&quot; failures simply don't matter. You can fasten 3 bars together with hinges or other joints that have little resistance to changing angle, and the triangle is still rigid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, rectangular grids can (and do -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t9MpNTSbYg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t9MpNTSbYg&lt;/a&gt;) completely collapse if their vertices aren't rigid enough. That combines badly with the fact that vertices concentrate forces, so have to be much stronger than sides in comparable settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A triangle cannot change without changing multiple things -- at least 2 angles and a side, or all three sides. Intuitively, the sides and vertices of a triangle work together for strength. This advantage of triangles doesn't transfer to hexagons, but hexagons have two other advantages: First, if you want to fill a space with a repeating shape, hexagons use less material than other shapes. And second, hexagons keep all the individual &quot;walls&quot; shorter compared to others shapes, which makes them less prone to bend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The material efficiency was proven by Thomas Hales in 1998, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/hexagons_are_the_most_scientifically_efficient_packing_shape_as_bee_honeycomb.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/hexagons_are_the_most_scientifically_efficient_packing_shape_as_bee_honeycomb.html&lt;/a&gt;.

It depends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For FDM printing, the printing time &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; scales linearly with the number of objects. However, some printers have a &quot;minimum layer time&quot; whereby smaller layers are printed more slowly, to ensure each layer takes at least this minimum time. This gives the print enough time to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the model shown in your example is quite small, it's quite likely that it will hit the minimum layer time. This means that printing one copy will take exactly as long as printing two copies, which will take exactly as long as printing three copies, until you hit the minimum layer time. At this point, adding more models will just add some constant number of minutes to your print time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the model is large enough for minimum layer time not to be a factor, then printing the objects one at a time is generally faster because you save on travel moves between the layers of the two objects (and also results in better quality print, since the inter-object travel moves may leave behind stringing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This only holds for FDM printing. For DLP printing, the printing time for a (set of) models only depends on their total height and thus the number of layers required, since each layer requires the same amount of time regardless of the amount of material printed. Thus, the time for 1, 2, 3,...n models is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other types of printing process where the number of layers is much more important than the amount of material used, such as binder jetting, SLA and SLS,... Here there usually is some time cost involved for material printed, but the main factor in the print time is the number of layers (and for SLS, the amount of time it takes for the build volume to cool down after each print, which is quite significant.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2017-02-28T05:37:51.187" CommentCount="0" />

The time saved came more from the fact that I could leave the printer for several hours and work on other tasks without having to babysit the printer waiting for it to finish each part.

If you're making parts for giggles and you don't need them done immediately, then i'd say one at a time. Less risk of failure, less wasted material and the time isn't super critical. If you're making parts for a prototype product that needs to be field tested in a few weeks, then i'd go with small batches of multiple parts.

Testing smaller, non-critical models is recommended to determine the level of increase. The design has to be re-engineered to provide for resin/epoxy flow within the model. Some epoxy and resin formulations generate heat when curing and may soften the model. The solution in such cases is to mix and pour small amounts, allowing for a pause between pours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to filling a model is to reduce the perimeter (if applicable)  and apply a reinforcing layer. I've constructed satisfactorily printed models with insufficient strength for my purposes, but then applied fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin to the outside. A single layer provided the necessary strength in my case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could apply sufficient layers to provide all the necessary strength, effectively turning the model into a positive mold. This is commonly done with amateur-built aircraft of the Burt Rutan design style. More recently, an article appeared on the internet of a model being printed with wash-away support material only, covered in carbon fiber. The wash-away was washed away and the wing structure became the product. For your application, it may not be necessary or practical to remove the inner model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as with the injection concept, one must re-engineer the model to allow for this type of reinforcement. Edges will have to be radiused or the sharp termination of reinforcement layer will become a weak point. Tight inside angles will have a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fiberglass cloth comes in various weights, measured in ounces per square foot (US). The lighter cloth is more capable of &quot;turning corners&quot; and fitting into tight angles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="854" LastActivityDate="2017-03-12T11:48:15.943" CommentCount="1" />

I had a friend who encountered this problem, at first we thought it was the slicer. Turns out, the wires for his extruder heater block and hot end fan were shorting, so whenever the extruder was turned on, it would keep heating no matter what the temp was set to. To test if this or something similar is happening, first unload your filament. Then, open up a small file in Simplify3D and set the temp to something low, like 100C. If the extruder turns on and just keeps heating, check your wiring. Make sure no wires are shorting and there are no bare/exposed connections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6384" LastActivityDate="2017-03-13T08:05:59.043" CommentCount="1" />

I'm not trying to push the envelope, I just want to be clear on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it legal if a design is rendered in a CAD program of a copyrighted material for &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; purpose of using, distributing, creating, mixing, internalizing, re-licensing under GPL/CC, or any unauthorized use outlined by the owner of the original work? For instance, if someone is demonstrating the abilities of a particular CAD and makes a mock-up of Mickey Mouse just to show the limits of said CAD and the STL/OBJ isn't released or distributed and a letter of intent is given along with the demonstration regarding the original work (in this case, Mickey), is that infringement? In this example, no loss of revenue or sales will affect the original owner, no claims of ownership is implied or stated, and no physical model will be created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While considering all of this, I figured that it wasn't very much different than if an artist sat down and drew a picture of Mickey Mouse. As long as the picture isn't sold, distributed, or released, in my mind, that is the same thing as a 3D render.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To further the details of the 3D model, the render would be made from scratch and not imported, copied, or reverse engineered from any other work. Bottom line, it will be a likeness that is created but it will be as close to the real thing as possible to demonstrate capabilities of a particular program (such as organic shapes, stitching, grouping, layering, or any other facet and characterization of 3D modeling).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I already understand that it is recommended to err on the side of caution and steer clear of things like this but it is more of a curiosity than a request for legal advice regarding a specific case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can this be covered under Fair Use?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since there is nothing to be made from creating the render, it isn't released or distributed to others, isn't re-licensed, and no ownership is implied/credit to the original owner is given, is this Free Use or copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6388" LastEditorUserId="6388" LastEditDate="2017-03-13T14:52:25.293" LastActivityDate="2017-03-13T16:34:01.883" Title="Can a 3D model of a copyrighted work be rendered legally without infringement?"

  <row Id="3739" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="3738" CreationDate="2017-03-13T15:05:45.183" Score="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you sell, distribute, release, license, profit from, claim ownership, etc... of something does not matter for copyright law. Copyright prohibits the very act of well, &lt;em&gt;copying&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, if a work is protected by copyright, you can't (among other things)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;make adaptations and arrangements of the work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;make reproductions in any manner or form&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;without permission (or a license) from the copyright holder. Just because you do something privately, don't distribute or profit from it, does not make you exempt from this rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases though, a fair use exception may apply. In the United States, uses that may be (but not necessarily are) fair are limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in Europe, teaching is usually not considered fair use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it would not in general be permitted to make a 3D model of a copyrighted work, even if you don't plan to do any of the things you listed with it. An artist would not be allowed to draw the picture of Mickey Mouse as you describe either. However, in the United States, your use could be construed as fair use for educational purposes. However, considering that you could equally as well have used some non-copyrighted work to demonstrate the limits of CAD (there's nothing specific to Mickey Mouse that makes him more suitable than any other model) I would recommend against this. An important argument in fair use is usually that there is no other option but to use the copyrighted work (e.g. in a class discussing pop music you have no option but to use excerpts of copyrighted lyrics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2017-03-13T16:34:01.883" LastActivityDate="2017-03-13T16:34:01.883" CommentCount="6" />
